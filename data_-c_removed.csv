" During the deep trenches and darkness of my addiction, my reward was my drug. The reward was usually an immediate one, as I was able to completely numb myself from the feelings, thoughts, people, and situations around me that caused my inner, unbearable pain. The problem, though, Was that I had created a severely unhealthy reward system……one that Reminds me of a Never-ending carousel ride, having my disease as the entity in charge of the controls. As the ride slowed down one day, I was able to jump off…to escape.   The once Dreadful carousel that I was on is no longer existent. Today I am in charge of the ride that I take. I am in charge of my actions and my decisions. Most importantly I am in charge of my abstinence and my road to recovery. The reward system I have built today  Provides me with the encouragement. This encouragement fuels my sobriety. Everyday that I go without using me reward myself with looking in the mirror and telling myself what a genuinely good and selfless human being me am. I deserve to be rewarded for each milestone I reach because this cunning disease is relentless. For my personal accomplishments during my recovery, I reward myself with a trip to the movies, or dinner with friends.   Today I am able to do things that embrace relaxation, and these moments of meditation, are the Rewards that I deserve, look forward to, and love.","ABSTINENCE,SELF ESTEEM / deserve & rewards","Abstainer Amazer,Inner Power Allower,Self Esteem Elixir,Sober Selfie",DRUGS/ALC,Jen,female

But I also realize that juggling all the problems caused by using is even harder work. The fact is, temptations will never really go away. And what safeguards me is my awareness of this fact.

Today these realizations enable me to stay focused on my recovery. To remain clean and sober, I am able to change all people, places, and things. These are my safeguards for sobriety. The thought of living the rest of my life sober sounds like a terrifying and impossible feat. But I don’t have to ponder the rest of my life. I can live in this moment, this hour this day.

This type of change is social physical emotional and mental and in order to give myself the best chance at sobriety modify quitting cold turkey, changing it to a warm turkey. I am ultimately in control of my decisions and behaviors and because I’m worth living a life free of alcohol and drugs I choose to get help and assistance from every resource around me. The thing is that I do not always know what’s best for me. What’s best for me is a collective decision and thought process that consist of the most effective plan for me.

I used to tell myself that I can’t fathom going through physical withdrawals and I have to maintain by using. I used to tell myself that I was weak, and I was in this battle alone.

To accomplish this it is important for me to continuously recognize that even though my addiction is in remission my impulses are not. Today, though, even though they exist, it is incredibly empowering to not only accept their existence, but also to raise doubts on their true worth. You see, it is not the impulses that hold all the power, it is how we value them. I am constantly impeaching these impulses.

"I remember the drip down the back of my throat. Every time I snorted painkillers--- it was a weird feeling that most people may not enjoy, it sort of reminds you of being sick, but that wasn’t the case for me. Before I get into the hype of the ritual process before I used, that sensation of the powder up my nose, and dripping down my throat instantly put me at ease. I smoked a cigarette right after, always, and really just wanted that to last forever. My entire body instantly felt relaxed, but I was also ready to take on the world. The only pain involved, for me, came later, and it was more emotion based. I never used a needle, (which helped justify my continued use), so the pain wasn’t noticeable physically, until I ran out of drugs and experienced withdrawals. The gratitude I felt using, after hours of withdrawal, was surreal. I rarely abused alcohol, because I loved drugs so much, but withdrawing was a different story. If I couldn’t find drugs, drowning myself in Jack Daniels seemed appropriate. But most of the time, alcohol limited the effects of the painkillers, so I often didn’t drink. These painkillers, or “blues,” also known as roxy’s, were my only solution, and my only problem. I couldn’t see anything beyond this pattern of getting and losing, getting and losing, because they felt so good. When I’d get blues, I had a very specific system of cutting them up, and organizing each line; it was like I was getting ready for hosting a party---the excitement of all the preparation for the main event. Except I was literally the only one going to this party, and after awhile, it did start to hurt---emotionally. When the happiness I received was greater from drugs than it was spending time with anyone I loved, it started to hurt. It started to hurt because everyone realized that before I even did. Then it really hurt. I kept using though. It was easier to numb guilt than face it. I had no courage at that point in my life, and often used excuses like, “well I’m not using a needle, so I must not be a drug addict.” Surely, these pills were legal somewhere, was a common thought. I never had a prescription for any of these pills, and obviously no appropriate evaluation for the occasional heroin use. It was when I stopped pills and went to heroin that my world really started moving in uncomfortable directions. It was always uncomfortable I’m sure, but when you do the one thing you said you’d NEVER do... it takes a toll. I never injected heroin but I did inhale it quite a bit. The smell of it wasn’t like the painkillers, and it grossed me out, but I became used to it after a few times. The drip feeling was still the same, only the feeling was much, much stronger.","POWERLESSNESS,DEMONS,CONFESSION / denial,TRUTH / dark past","Guilt X’r,Excuse X’r,Pain Abstainer,Demon Doctor,Just One Justifier",DRUGS/ALC,Alys,female

"I was so blocked by feeling good from the drugs, no alternative seemed comparable to using. No goal, hobby, or past interest, held my attention anymore. When I found opiates, I felt like I found my soul mate, in some weird, twisted way. No other drug did it for me---it relaxed me, but also gave me confidence to be more social. But realistically, these drugs stripped, not only my personality, but my, soul away, and honestly, I forgot what my interests even were. Now, I begin exploring what makes me happy. As an active addict, many blind spots were present. Simply, I didn’t have the confidence to explore new things. I was too attached to my old ways because it’s all I knew for so long. When it came to the hardships of life, finding healthy alternatives wasn’t even on my radar. Today though, I am capable of relieving my stress in healthy ways, and finding healthy outlets to strengthen my foundation. In recovery, it is important that I have mental, emotional, and physical stimulation to combat any and all mental, emotional, and physical trauma I have endured in my addiction. Yoga, meditation, and other forms of exercise are crucial to maintaining my emotional, mental, and physical wellbeing. I would like to retrain my brain, so my first response to stress is to focus on a hobby, or, even explore new interests.

Every, “I’m sorry,” I ever said had no value to it, because I kept repeating my mistakes. No one took me seriously. I didn’t take me seriously. It is up to me now to actually change my behavior. I forgive myself for my actions in my past. I am strong, and I am not my mistakes. I can change.

"When I received bad news in the past, my first instinct was to pick up a drug or drink. Pills, whiskey, and heroin were literally my only solutions. I had no working knowledge of acceptance in my life, no idea how to apply it, and taking the easy way out was, well, easier. Half of the reason why I used was because I never learned how to face life. But after awhile, avoiding life, became more painful than life itself. Now, with some clarity, and some positive people around me, I am able to accept life on life’s terms. Acceptance is my answer to all outside problems I face, and all inner struggles I face. It is through the practice of this acceptance, that I may become less affected by bad news, and more inclined to act positively when such bad news arises. Life is not happening to me, but often, happening for me. Lessons can be found in bad times, and I have gained the clarity now to see them. I prayed to see the truth once, regarding a romantic relationship. I didn’t know what I was doing, but someone told me to try it, so I did. Very soon after, I found out some extremely painful news about my significant other. While it was horrible, and ended our relationship, I realized the universe was taking care of me.

I have gained enough self-awareness that I can stop myself in my tracks, before I act in self-destructive ways. I remember what it was like while using, especially when I listen to newcomers and their struggles. I do not want to go back to that life, so I constantly look at myself to avoid going backwards.

One of the issues many people who cope with addiction have is the inability or discomfort with surprises and spontaneity.

For example, if a big event is coming up and there will be alcohol, then one of the strategies is to ensure that non-alcoholic beverages are also available. For me, it’s more when life presented me with health challenges, I turned to multiple forms of medications and treatments instead of sitting down and thinking it through. Now, I do.

The brain needs to reboot and begin thinking in entirely different and new ways. The way to do this, is to sit down and take stock of how your thinking went awry.

Don’t try to deal with everything at once as that will only overwhelm you. My main conflict trigger has always been about money.

Even though I may feel that I am right, I don’t always have to prove it and pound the point home. Focusing on getting my feelings across in an argument isn’t respectful of the other person that I am arguing with. Holding onto anger and resentment is a killer for me. When I am most angry, I am better off walking away and processing and looking for MY PART in the disagreement. Often, in the heat of the moment, all I can see is the other person’s part.

That way, I will not hurt myself or the other person by continuing to fan the flames of my anger and retelling the story with each and every gory detail. If it continues to come up, I will continue to pray about it and talk to my sponsor and then focus on helping someone else.

Yes, when we begin this prayer, we are still angry and consider them bastards. But, as we pray for them every single day, we pray for the things we want for ourselves for them, our anger dissipates. Amazingly, after a time, God will heal our hearts and we may repair relationships with people we feel have harmed us. Sometimes, we are not healed enough to continue interaction, that is ok as long as we are not keeping our anger locked in our hearts. If continuing a relationship will jeopardize my recovery, I have to make the decision to either put the relationship on hold or end it altogether.

By trusting God and asking him to show me my part, I can learn to release my anger to the universe and move forward in a positive way.

Some days, I still experience pain that makes me feel like the sewer grate was put back on top of the hole.

I told my son, “Be grateful that you had friends you cared enough about to experience the pain of losing them.” The next day, in our mailbox, my son received a note that said, “Thanks for being my friend”.

I am constantly trying to manage her time, judging what I feel she should or should not be doing. Telling her things like, “you’re spending too much time on your phone, did you clean your room, and have you even started your homework”. Micromanaging her life shows my disapproval and makes her feel like I don’t trust her to make her own decisions. With teenagers, there is a fine line. If I don’t tell her to do anything, she will ask me to push her or call her on what she is doing? When I do it too much, it turns her off. Being a recovered mom is not an easy job, but a very fulfilling one if I am open to changing my behaviors. In the same way that I like to control others, I like to be in control. I feel very threatened when I must rely on someone else and I can’t trust that my needs will be met. For me, I often will do something and resent doing it rather than ask for help.

"Accidents happen. I've known that since childhood. Sometimes, something happens for no good reason, and it sucks. Maybe someone spills their coffee on their carpet, maybe someone stubs their toe. In my case, I got addicted to drugs. I had to accept my addiction before I could accept it as an accident. For most of my dependency, I refused to accept I had a problem - that way, I had nothing to fix. I hadn't made any accidents, and I had no reason to apologize to myself. As I lost friends, I began to accept those as accidents - not my own fault. ""He doesn't want to talk to me? What an idiot - all I did was accidentally say something mean."" I 'accidentally' lost my house. When I 'accidentally' lost my girlfriend, I started thinking about how maybe I'd accidentally fallen into an unsustainable lifestyle. That acceptance allowed me to see all the damage I'd done, and take it upon myself. I had no desire to to drugs after this - the last few years had just been one, drawn-out accident. Through sober eyes, I accept that now - and I don't think I'll ever go back.","VULNERABILITY / learning and mistakes,ACCOUNTABILITY / damage confess,TRUTH / Inventory,CONFESSION","RAW SOUL REVEALER / past mistakes,ADMIT / accountability,Responsibility Baby Stepper,CLOSET CONFESSOR / Inventory",DRUGS/ALC,Nigel,male
"I used to always hurt - anxiety, depression, and insecurity were a big part of my life, and by early teenagehood I'd admitted this much to myself. In a feeble attempt to stop the pain, I started using drugs. What really took strength to admit was not the emotional pain I felt as a teen - it was admitting that the Band-Aid I'd slapped over my problems was causing me more agony than ever before. Suddenly, the solution had become more of a problem than the problem had ever been - and it took me years to accept that.

What was all the hype? I found out pretty quick, and this new 'alternative' became my everyday habit. I grew dependent to the point that I started losing friends. All but my closest friends had left me, and only when my girlfriend did, too, did I consider that maybe I needed to make a change. There weren't a whole lot of alternatives to explore at first - either I sit in my trashed apartment and wait for my landlord to come take me out with the garbage, or get off my ass and go to detox.

I broke a lot of friendships off by being selfish, I lost a good relationship and housing situation.

I graduated quickly from smoking weed to smoking heroin, though - and heroin deprived my brain of a lot of positive emotion. I treated my friends like crap, but of course, I would never think I was doing so. They would tell me, try to arrest my anger and ration with me – but this only made me more angry. I needed someone to arrest my anger, and I couldn't do it myself. It took me the loss of everything important before I realized that the only way I could stop my problems was my stopping my addiction. Rehab would be my anger arrester. I bit the bullet and went through the painful process of detox. Each day the agony of withdrawal coursed through my body, I felt the residual anger depart with it.

"It certainly wasn't autopilot that drove me to start using drugs. That was a carefully (mis)calculated decision, dotted with doubts and apprehension. I overrode my autopilot, but it came back with a vengeance once I developed an addiction. Similar to an average Joe's autopilot, I'd wake up, eat breakfast, go to work - but mine followed the more aggressive routine of: wake up sick, skip breakfast, go find money for drugs. That was the autopilot that coordinated my life for too many years. Eventually, I hit a point where it truly auto-stopped: I woke up one day, seeing the trashed apartment my girlfriend had just left me in, the empty parking space where my truck had sat, the vacant couches where friends could have been lounging. After all that, I finally noticed that I had a problem.

Just like I took small steps towards my addiction, I had to take small steps through the recovery process.

My friends would speak about my usage like it was bad news – and I'd cast their suggestions out the window. Addiction isn't tangible. I couldn't walk out the door and see that my life had fallen out of my control - so I refused this news, until it became obvious to me that I had a problem too big to fix by myself.

I'd blame relapses on my anxiety, instead of seeking other methods of therapy. The entire years I spent as a junkie, I would blame anyone and anything just to avoid accepting who I'd become.

That certainly failed, because by sixteen I was addicted to heroin and close to living on the streets. The dope reinforned my BAD behaviours, and I found myself in a vicious spiral.

This only made the cycle worse. Eventually, I lost everything important to me – my house, my friends, my girlfriend. There were, literally, no benefits to focus on – aside from the possibility that sobriety might make things better. I went through detox. During withdrawals, knowing that I couldn't access dope, I focused on the benefits of sobriety. This would get rid of the sickness.

I invested time and money in it at a young age, and this opened me up to a world of drugs. I got addicted, hard, and fast. Soon I was doing heroin daily - and a junkie like myself is truly the expert of cost-benefit.

I was a recreational user who found a substance that I really enjoyed, and that was it. I had friends warn me of my impending addiction, of my disrespectful attitudes when I was using. I thought them to be rude, and these friends became acquaintances, who eventually left - and it was all their fault, I believed. Denial. Denial. Denial. Only once I had nobody left, I'd gotten evicted, and my girlfriend flew back across the country to get away from me and the drugs – only then, did I began to consider that I had a problem. At first, I still denied it - but it was obvious. I began debunking the denial, accepting the problems I've caused and the person I was. With each denial I debunked, I found myself leaning towards rehab - until I knew entirely that it was the only way to pull myself up from rock bottom.

"My dependency - like anyone's, really - was a constant downward spiral. I'd do drugs, I'd tell myself I wasn't addicted, and then the comedown would hit me. The comedowns weren't even bad at first – they'd only make me feel sober again. Sobriety seemed boring, though, so I'd redose. Soon, I started getting sick without a fix, and when the sickness hit, I'd redose harder. The spiral slung me downwards fast. For years, my life was spent crawling deeper into this dependency that I'd dug myself into, holding a dying torch and looking for any way to find dope. After I hit rock bottom, I had nothing left. There was nowhere to spiral downwards to, short of killing myself. I tried that, in fact - but, luckily, I wasn't successful. When I woke up, I realized that there were other options. An upward spiral – one that could pull me out of this horrible place. It took a lot of work, but I began stepping back towards the things I'd lost. I detoxed, I found my old friends, and soon enough brought myself completely out of the spiral.

Such was the luck of my good childhood - my endorphin system developed (somewhat) normally, and I was able to experience an almost normal amount of joy and happiness. Unfortunately, I didn't know what endorphins were until I found out about drugs. I also found out then that there were ways to flood the synapses with even more endorphins than your body's supposed to produce. I heard rumours of withdrawals, brain damages, structural damage to neurotransmitters... but that would only be an issue if I got addicted. That only happened to idiots – not smart kids, like me, who researched drugs first. Inevitably, I got addicted. My brain quickly forgot how to create its own endorphins. Chasing that feeling - eventually chasing the state of mind I'd always had as a lad - led me into a deep addiction which ruined my life. I was fortunate enough to get out of it, though, through rigorous detoxing. The feeling I experienced after going clean was unlike anything I'd known before - my brain, learning to produce its own endorphins again, gives a rush unlike any other.

At night, I'd focus on how I'd go sober in the morning, and in the morning, I'd focus on how I'd avoid getting drugs. Everything changed when I rolled out of bed and realized how dopesick I was, and then my focus would shift onto getting dope as fast as possible. Eventually, the dope consumed my life. I lost my house and all my friends and had no choice but to go to rehab. Once I went through a vicious withdrawal, I came out and felt sobriety for the first time in ages – and it was beautiful.

The reason I got into drugs was because they enabled me to reach even deeper – the rush of endorphins endowed me with more honesty and acceptance than I'd ever felt before, and I began to develop some serious connections for the first time – that lasted even into sobriety, As drug use became an addiction, though, my ability to reach out grew stagnant. I tried to reach, but could never get any deeper than I could have before my addiction. The drugs were all I reached for, and I needed someone else to reach down inside me and slap some common sense into me. That never happened, though, and I lost all the important things in my life. I ended up homeless and friendless, and at that time, I finally reached down into myself and saw my faults. I was the only one who could change, so I went to rehab. Rehab helped me get sober, but I still had changes to make – I kept reaching deeper into myself and isolating the issues that had led me to addiction in the first place.

I distracted myself from drugs by doing more drugs, and this only deepened my connection with the disease. I was distracted enough, but I was only making the disease worse.

I would lash out at my friends, and they would try to regulate me – but, of course, I refused. Nothing could regulate me except drugs – so I thought – but they just made the problemworse. When I lost everything, I realized it was time to check myself. I needed to regulate my own emotions, and the only way I could do that was by going sober. I went to detox, and as each day of withdrawal passed, I became more under control of my own feelings.

"A drug addiction comes with many hardships. External hardships - fights with friends, cars breaking down, having a bad day at work - I accepted easily. Why? Because it gave me an excuse to do more dope. My addiction masked problems that shouldn't have even been seen as problems, and I relished that because it gave me more reason to do dope. What wasn't easy to accept was that I was the cause of these hardships. I had friends tell me that what I was doing was stupid, I had family members voice concerns that I didn't accept because I thought they were silly. The world was being hard on ME, I thought - so I had to do drugs to ease the pain. Only now can I accept hardships easily, because I accepted something truly difficult - that, for the years of my addiction, I'd caused myself and many others hardships that shouldn't have been. Accepting such a horrible thing about myself has made external hardships much easier to accept, and I have a much easier time dealing with my life these days.","HARDSHIP,CONFIDENCE /  obstacles & challenge,ACCOUNTABILITY / damage confess","Hardship Hugger,ADMIT / healing,VULNERABILITY / Radical self honesty,Problem Soul-ver,Responsibility Baby Stepper",DRUGS/ALC,Nigel,male

My life had been programmed pretty well - I had a good home life, got fair grades in school, made friends. As with any programming, sometimes there's a malfunction. Despite my life experience, I decided it would be a good idea to get into drugs. I didn't realize the syntax error until I'd been addicted for a few years - and even then, it was difficult to find out where it lay. When drugs overwrote the system code in my life, the entire program slowed. My existence was a glitch - a paused video game where I couldn't score points. I had to hack the hardships out of my life, and this was far from easy. My life had been programmed in the background for me, and suddenly, I had to jump into an endless cycle of variables and factors that determined my actions, isolate the problems, and delete them.

Maybe I grew tired of being the one offering help, because somehow I decided to get into drugs. I became addicted quite quickly, and soon, I was hopeless. I didn't want someone to hug me though - instead, I clung to my hopelessness, because it was the only way I could justify using drugs. I held onto it for as long as I could until I truly was at my wit's end - no house, no friends, no life. I clung to my hopelessness as long as I could, but it left me as a hollow shell.

" Handling hostility has long been a hobby of mine. I had a lot of aggressive friends as a child, and I was often the mediator that diffused tense situations. When I got into drugs, though, I lost this talent – I needed someone else to handle my own hostility. This, of course, wasn't easy. As an addict, I wasn't jumping to admit that I had a problem. Most of the folk who tried to help me, I rejected – there were only a couple people that I held so dear that I'd be willing to accept their criticisms of my actions. Even though I lost my house and my girlfriend, the last couple friendships that still stood were enough for me to check the way I'd been acting. I knew that nobody could handle my hostility but myself, so I went to detox. In detox, I got a grip on my own aggression. I realized the way I'd mistreated people, and myself. I used this knowledge to separate myself negative judgments and instead, use them as milestones to better myself as a person.

"I was quite a left-brained, logical kid. I liked mathematics, scientific analysis, things like that. I liked learning in a logical way. I logically deduced, during my teens, that experimenting with drugs would offer enough new perspective with minimal brain damage for me to expand my understanding of the world, without having any repercussions. Drugs sure changed the way my mind worked. After a few years of frying myself I was no longer logical - I was plain illogical. I began to justify using drugs that, deep down, I knew were hurting me. I got stuck in an illogical loop in which I justified using drugs to mask the pain that I felt because I'd been killing pain with drugs. Senseless, stupid - and incessant. My addiction fed into this loop for years until I'd eventually lost everything to it. Only when I sat alone at rock bottom, looking at the fragments of my old life, did some sense of logic come back. I needed to go clean, and I needed to do it now - so I did. I went through detox and found myself sober again after a painful period of withdrawal. My old sense of logic never quite returned - it seems the left brained boy I was became a right-brain oriented man - and I think I prefer it this way.

This was largely the reason I let myself get into drugs - seemed like a cool idea, so I jumped on it. For a few years, this destroyed any meager sense of control I might have had. In high school, if someone wanted to punch me, I'd dodge the blow because it would hurt. Now, as a drug addicted nobody, I willingly let myself get beaten down by dope all the time because I wanted them in my system. Soon it got to the point where I lost control over everything, and my whole life fell apart. Since then, I've been able to control my impulses. I had to learn how to, because if I didn't, I'd lose more than my house and my job. I'd lose my life, or if I didn't, the one I would lead would be horrible. I finally checked myself into a rehab and have learned to control any impulses that arise nowadays. Sure, the cravings strike back sometimes - but the struggle of detox strengthened my mind enough to know how to accept the craving for what it is.

I was a shell of who I'd once been, guided only by drugs. The layers of personality I lived through were simply being high, or being dope-sick. It took some seriously tough situations for me to look beyond the dependency and remember that there had been more to me before my addiction.

Instinct, essentially, guided me towards drugs – and drugs overrode my insinctual tendencies. I began refusing my actual instinct. My addiction became my instinct, and I was guided only towards drugs. It felt natural – it felt like instinct – but my true instinct was begging for me to stop. I wouldn't listen to it, though. I'd allowed my dependency to invent my new instinct. This new guiding force led me nowhere but to a depressive, homeless, friendless existence.

For the first time, I felt comfortable enough in my own skin to talk to people at a party. I felt comfortable expressing my feelings. I even picked up a guitar and gave it a couple strums. My journey had been stagnant, I thought - drugs were the map to a better future! I'd say most addicts are similar at the start. I was invincible. It was simply not possible that I'd get addicted. I only used the drugs to progress the journey of life. This changed over the years though, and as my addiction progressed, the journey through life fell short.

This was a hard thing to forgive myself for. My friends found it much easier - they just were happy to see me go through rehab. For me, though, happiness took its time to find me. I first had to accept that I'd single-handedly ruined years worth of close relationships because of my own weakness. Still, having accepted that, I appreciated what little I still had left.

"Life as an addict was simple. I still relish it, in a sense - there were no out-of-reach goals (except when the dealer wouldn't answer his phone.) Life followed simple milestones -1. get out of bed without puking. 2. find cash. 3. call a dealer who was loaded. 4. suffer the walk to his place. 5. get high! A simple five track process that repeated day in, and day out, with a satisfying climax and a horrible denouement. These were the wrong sorts of milestones, though - because they never got me anywhere. The fifth milestone, the ""end"" of the process, would end with me being sick and sending me straight back to the beginning. This regime led to the ultimate destruction of all my friendships and stability in life. I was left with nothing but a new perspective - one that shied away from the milestones I'd lived by and began to illuminate a new path. A path that led to sobriety. These steps took a much stronger looking glass to see, but when I did, I zoomed right in and didn't stop. 1. Isolate from my triggers. 2. Get to rehab safely. 3. Hurt for a week. 4.

My motivation was still strong, but it was only dedicated towards one thing -getting drugs. Since it was such a powerful motivating force, I never questioned it – just followed it.

One person whose motives I never explored... was myself. I never wondered why I got into drugs. I never bothered to figure out why I kept using them. Instead, I'd just come up with excuse after excuse - finding reason for my lack of reasoning. This is, clearly, not a sustainable method to live by, and I soon found myself unmotivated to do anything except score dope. With this as my main goal in life, I quickly lost my conscience in the addiction, until I was homeless and broke. Only then did I begin to question my motives. Why was I this far down at rock bottom? What could possess me to keep using from this point on? What made this acceptable to me? The answer didn't really come – there was no excuse to live like this. As soon as I knew that, I was motivated to change - I'd covered it up my vigor with excuses to keep using dope. That moment, I explored my motivation for the first real time - and it led me to detox.

Everyone's motives were wrong except mine. This mindset left me with no friends, no house, and no girlfriend.

"My internal monologue – as is the same with most folk – was never monitored. I was guided by an underlying mental chatter, and a lot of this was negative. This allowed me to be comfortable choosing to do drugs. The deeper I got into my drug dependency, the more negative my thoughts became. My friends monitored this negativity for me – I would hear that I was being passive-aggressive, disagreeable, or outright confrontational - but I never accepted it. Once my friends disappeared from my life, and my girlfriend told me for the last time that I was being a complete idiot and left, did I start to reconsider. How did I get here? Certainly nobody had driven me – I had. My own self-directed negativity had led me into this destructive pit, and I'd sat there festering in my own negative thoughts. I was able to monitor my thoughts now, and they were all negative. This had to stop, so I went to detox. During detox, I watched the way my mind worked.

This makes a huge difference - like a lot of addicts, I quit because I feared the damage the drug was doing... but I still wanted the drug itself. This cycle repeated for years. My last binge lasted almost three. At the end of this binge, I connected some dots from different parts of my life and came to realize that every significant problem I'd had in the last six years - relationships, housing, vehicle issues - had, in some way, been related to drugs. Sitting on the floor of my house with no mattress and two roommates who had just left me, I knew that this would keep happening if I let myself keep relapsing. That was the first moment I truly wanted to stop doing drugs. That day, I ditched most of what I owned in the apartment and checked into detox. I had no desire to ever use again - not because I didn't enjoy the drug, but because the repercussions were obvious to me now, and I knew they would never change I'm sure I'm still an addict – just an addict that has no desire to relapse.","WARNINGS / Relapse & tools,COMMITMENTS,MINDSET / no matter what","Lapse Lessonizer,Killer Kickstarter,Addiction AMF’r,COMMITMENT knitter / above all else",DRUGS/ALC,Nigel,male

Heroin addicts aren't all needle-flaunting junkies huddled under decrepit staircases, but that's what most people think of when they hear of a junkie. Our society's ripe with stigma stigmatizers, and it's perpetuating the prejudiced cycle.

The last time we went out and he drank, I ate foods that weren’t good for me. What’s the difference between his behavior and mine; nothing. Except, the fact that I blamed my behavior on his behavior. I made the decision that this particular setting (with a number of alcohol abusers) and lots of food is not where I want to be. I told the friend who had us over that I’d be happy to visit for lunch, but I couldn’t do the drinking party thing any more. Setting that boundary is empowering.

One thing that really helps me if my food hasn’t been where I want it to be me.e.: too many meals out, not getting enough or having too much volume of heathy foods. The thing that helps me is to go grocery shopping, to get healthy foods into the house. I have certain one pot meals that usually can bring me back into a healthier way of eating. One is a healthy minestrone with a homemade meatball or chicken, I call it liquid veggies with white beans, spinach, tomato juice, and carrots. I make it almost stew like and add the protein in at each serving so I am sure I am getting enough. I also have healthy breakfast items that I make ahead to keep me on track.

If we are painstaking about this phase of our development, we will be amazed before we are halfway through. – If I don’t do the work, I will not be amazed before I am halfway through – I will relapse.

We will not regret the past or wish to shut the door on it. – By doing the step work, I was able to reconcile my past and accept the things that held me back. Doing things like looking at my part in the areas where I felt wronged has been an eye opening experience. 4. We will comprehend the word serenity and we will know peace. – When I am in my disease, there is no room for God, no connection to God. If food is my God, I will not know peace. With recovery comes the opportunity to truly connect to my God and lighten the burden that I carry each day. 5. 5.

Life has endless possibilities when I follow the path that God has set for me rather than the path of destruction that awaits me in addiction. 10. 10.

I finally asked God to help me and he showed me a way to make some extra money through sharing my experience, strength and hope in writing about recovery.

We will intuitively know how to handle situations that used to baffle us. - I know now, that if I am bothered by something, it is necessary to address it in some way. I can no longer stuff my feelings because I am afraid of conflict. I also choose not to eat over my feelings. The only way out is through. A much better way to live awaits me if I trust my instincts and address my feelings. 12. 12. We will suddenly realize that God is doing for us what we could not do for ourselves. – Each week, I go to an OA recovery meeting. At the meeting, before you go in there is a prayer board where you write something you are struggling with. One week, I stopped and wrote down help my husband find a job. Within a few months, he got a job in his field. Next, I wrote down help my daughter with her anxiety. I recently found an excellent therapist for her. The last thing I wrote down is help me with finances. I have been given the direction by God to freelance as a writer and write recovery articles. The fear of economic insecurity has left me. The act of writing down my prayers and posting them allowed me to really let go of my control over them. As soon as I let go, God got to work. I know today that God is truly working miracles in my life.","FREEDOM / tools & strategies,PROGRESS / rewards & proud,SOBRIETY / behavior & action","Progress Painter,The Successcalator,Values VIP’r,Sobriety 101'r",FOOD,Shar,female

I don’t drink and have issues with my husband’s alcohol use. Invariably, he not only drinks, he does shots all night and gets out of control. By the end of the night, I justify eating sugar because he made me so upset. A recovery friend suggested that I was using his disease as an excuse to pick up. What would be the difference if I started drinking again, or used heroin. Addiction is addiction. The lesson I learned is this: there are people, places, and things that I have to avoid to protect my recovery.

"Recovery is a lot of hard work. If someone tells you it’s easy, they are not working a strong program. Is it worth the effort? Absolutely. Focusing on weight loss and changing my eating not temporarily but forever, one day at a time is what is required. That means changing everything about the way that I think about food. I can’t leave my food plan up in the air. I commit to a healthy, structured plan of eating and do the work to follow that plan. Grocery shopping to get the foods that are necessary for my food plan is one of the things that I have to do on a regular basis. Once I get the foods in the house, food prep is an integral part of following a food plan. I tend to cook in batches, so that I am prepared to have my meal plan covered for several days. I will often make a few things at once so planning my food for the week is easier. This week, I made chili, two meat loafs and roasted potatoes and carrots. I can add a salad and I am set for the next few nights for dinner.","BABY STEPS / Accomplishments,PROGRESS / start small,CHANGE / action & behavior,GROWTH / behavior & habits","Progress Painter,Sober Selfie,WAIT AND SWITCH / Small steps,The Successcalator,New Pattern Painter / grit & progress,COMMITMENT knitter / celebrate",FOOD,Shar,female

"IN my addiction, I never really worried about the risks associate with my behavior. As my weight went up, I was more focused on filling the empty void and didn’t worry about the possible repercussions. I drank and ate whatever I wanted, whenever I wanted. As I saw how badly it was affecting all aspects of my life, I joined a diet club to address the eating first. One thing I learned there was how to follow a healthy plan of eating, and weigh and measure my food. What soon happened was that I ended up either restricting in diet mode or bingeing because my body craved more. I did have a net weight loss when I finished, but I knew that my eating behaviors were not normal and that this type of behavior would not work over the long haul. In OA, I learned that severely restricting and binge eating are a form of bulimic behavior.

There is more to life than the pleasure you think you are getting from excess alcohol and food. I used to think that I couldn’t enjoy myself without these substances.

"I have experienced depression in and out of recovery. Out of recovery, I quit school and saw a doctor and go on medication to deal with my depression. It was intense and painful. As a college student, I was not able to process all the changes that were occurring as well as a lot of the family issues that I grew up with. When I was on my own, I was unable to work them out and sought help. I was able to get the help that I needed, take the necessary medication and get better. I have also suffered depression since I came into recovery. I think because I am dealing with my feelings more and not eating over them, although I still feel somewhat depressed, it is not as severe. The danger for me is to use the depression as an excuse, to feel terminally unique. If you were as depressed as I am, you would eat too. Some of the depression that I have felt in recovery has been more situational. I have seen doctors to help me, when required. In recovery, with no addictive substances to lean on, I am left with processing my feelings to work through my problems.

For me, it is important to focus on the people in my recovery program who can help me process my part and not just focus on what someone else did to me, which is the natural inclination. God helps to hug me when I am in pain and he has put people in my life that can provide love and support when I am struggling. I try to reach out to God and my support system in those moments to help lessen my pain. They say that God can and will if he is sought. If I don’t let God in to help me, even with human aid and hugs from friends, the pain will not completely go away.

Yes, our parents can shape who we are, but as we become adults and are able to make our own choices, our bad decisions and problems are OURS to own. We cannot blame decisions we make as adults on our parents that is not fair to them.

"My disease has progressed to the point where if I have sugar, I will binge. Maybe not in that first bite, but most likely within 24 hours or a binge, I will pick up more sugar. If I have excess sugar, my system starts to crave more and it consumes my thoughts and actions. It becomes difficult to go to the pharmacy or grocery store and not get candy. When I have had a binge, I have to make a conscious effort to debinge by surrounding myself with recovery, going to meetings, and being honest with my sponsor about where I am. Another way that I debinge is by watching people, places and things. I may even stay away from going to certain stores by myself or certain restaurants until my system is healed from the effects of excess sugar. It is important for me to understand the gravity of my addiction and when I have had a problem really focus on getting my life back by focusing on my recovery and protecting myself from the insidious nature of my disease (especially when my addictive substances are still in my system).","BINGE,INNER MASTERY / challenge & resilience,INNER POWER / Self control & willpower","The Debinger,Dire Extinguisher,Crisis Catapulter,SELF HARM ALARMER / avoid triggers",FOOD,Shar,female

I tell the family where they are and ask them to finish them so they won’t tempt me for too long. If I am not consuming my “alcohol” usually most foods don’t bother me, but I still have to be careful.

I had to embrace the change first. The only way to do that was for me to recognize that there was an issue- that my thoughts, feelings, and emotions were tied to pot and, that as I was, I could not escape it. Without my acknowledgment, it would get no better. I would feel broken and vulnerable, always cravings and having flashbacks that would only add up, and I would not be able to move forward and forge the meaningful relationships that I wanted to have.

Was this for other people? Or was it ultimately for both? The reason this is simple but powerful: in my experience, women have trouble understanding why I was drawn to pot. In reality, it was a negative self-image and self-doubt. For me, I had to change for both of the above answers: myself and others. My motivation was to have a stronger mind, free from the bondage of having to get high for at least an hour a day, sometimes even more. This freedom allowed me to finally find what I wanted in life: companionship.

My dad is addicted to cigarettes, and I saw him as a young pre-teen trying to go “cold turkey.” With tobacco, most doctors don't even suggest doing this all at once. For pot users, we have a bit of a different dilemma as what we are doing has no way to be tampered down. One session, if you will, can cause months of setbacks and feelings that take so long to suppress (I feel as if I will never fully forget pot). The activity can't be reduced by half and then half again. I can't try and do it just once a week. It's still my crutch. It's still going to bring me right back to my lowest low if I do it just once.

Figuring out how to control my urge to get high is a step in the right direction. Unlike my dog expecting to be fed after going outside in the morning, I am capable of controlling my impulses. It is NEVER easy and there is lots of self-doubt and fear, but with it I know I can control my compulsion. I can differentiate between having no control of a situation and being out of control. I absolutely love to be in control. I am a classic controller. I was team captain. I was always in charge of projects at school. I am now a coach and can't stand when someone doesn't listen to me word-for-word. So pot was a way for me to have control. But little did I know that it actually was taking control of me! So it is here that is my starting point: I let go of the things I can't control and free myself of that burden, which helps me lose the burden of my addiction.

"NOT avoiding conflict became very important to me as a I struggled to escape the bondage of my pot addiction. There was major conflict in my life that caused me to see the world in a very warped way. What I saw was a cold, callused world that had no cares or emotions. As such, I manifested that by doing something that for all intents and purposes that had no emotion to it. It was simply action. I tried to solve conflict at first by becoming a “referee” in the divorce of my parents. I tried to bring everyone together. Then I began to let more and more conflicts lead me down further and further into my personal hole. Avoiding conflict is not the answer, rather knowing how to deal with it is how I was able to take a step in the right direction. I just can't bottle this up, I can't bottle up my emotions like I am thoughtless or some tough warrior- men have emotions to- or I will let it out all at once in a huge relapse of epic proportions. It is important to make that point one more time. I HAVE EMOTIONS! I may handle them better than my wife, I may not be as jealous as she is. But I do get jealous. And when I do, I need to talk about those things. If I avoid that conflict, there will be problems. Major problems. But if I can talk, I can alleviate them and get on the right path.

It could literally be anything or it could be nothing. Sometimes I wouldn't even want it. I could tell. My body could tell. But I had been triggered by some conflict, or was it my thoughts? I have learned that pot thoughts are very difficult to get rid of. I don't know if I can get rid of them, or if I can just suppress them to be honest. To an extent, they are always there, lingering. So when someone did me wrong, at least in my estimation, I was going to make it all better by locking myself in and smoking pot and forgetting about it. The problem was there when I was done, only I was more insecure, more hurt, and more scarred. I learned to talk out my feelings. I tried to let others know when I was hurt.

"Taking a moment to explore my thoughts and feelings about where my pot addiction was taking me was always very important. Throughout my entire addiction, I have known and acknowledged consequences. I didn't know all of them, as they are numerous, and I still don't know them all. However, I know there are many that have long-lasting effects. My relationships with others were severely harmed. I was sometimes more late for things that I normally would have been. I felt less confident in myself and my own body. Little things add up, and people know it. I stayed insular, I didn't look for work. By exploring the consequences, I could see who all was hurt by my actions instead of just seeing it as an individual battle. One of the major things that my wife and I had to talk about, and what I want to get out there, is a significant consequence. That being the perception of pot. I will say right now that having smoked pot I did NOT have unrealistic expectations for what life was going to be like. I did not think that it should be like how I felt, and I didn't want it to be that way. I can't speak for other people, but I can say that. However, my wife and other people in my life believed that I expected certain things because of this addiction. As a result, my wife's self-esteem was hurt.

I wasn't able to go find the companionship I desperately craved most. I wasn't able to play soccer, which I love. I wasn't even able to concentrate fully on a game that I wanted to watch. I couldn't even make it through a whole match at times without wanting to smoke pot.

"Dealing with craving cramps as a pot addict is a cyclical process. This is not as prevalent as it would be for a drug user, for instance, but it is still powerful and has to be overcome. For me, I was usually mindless when I would smoke pot. If I was disengaged, it was much easier for me to slip into smoking. So, when this occurred, particularly in the morning or in the mid-to-late afternoon, or even well after supper, I would be hungry. Hunger is my enemy in my fight. When I don't fuel my body, I lose focus and sharpness. And I would start to hurt. And since I didn't want to have a relationship because of whatever my reason was at the time, I reverted to pot.

To restrain my cravings meant to remove myself from negativity and my potential triggers. I don't simply run from my problems, however.

"Witnessing one of my own cravings was and is a very harrowing experience. It could come at just about anything. A memory is usually the catalyst, however.

Maybe sometimes just the name being dropped would cause this for me. And instantly my brain just remembers and bam. I'm feeling anticipation in that very moment and I want to run back to those feelings. When the craving does subside, I feel the love of my wife and appreciation I have for her. I feel this the OVERWHELMING part of the time, but I know that the cravings are there. And it can get depressing, especially when I am haunted by my past. I can't go back and change those things.

I had a hard time getting over the divorce of my parents. In turn, I felt like there wasn't true “love,” and that I'd just never find it anyway. So that led to my addiction. As things continued to seemingly spiral out of control to me, I began to use every difficult situation in my life as an excuse or a reason to watch. Soon, I began to hate myself for watching. That caused a cycle of despair that ended us, you guessed it: watching pot. But there was a silver lining: at least I knew that this was happening to me, that it was a crutch.

"Some people in today's world would rather avoid triggers than even acknowledge them. I don't like to hear negative things about me or my loved ones, my beliefs, or my actions. However, avoiding them doesn't mask the fact that they happen. I know they happen, and I must accept it and know that it is a part of my life. My pot addiction can't be kicked simply by avoiding all adversity in life. The reason why is this: when I smoke pot, I am locked up alone; when I avoid triggers, I am alone. I am already more than half way toward going back to my addiction. I must acknowledge my trigger and meet it as best as I can by looking it in the face and saying no. What this means is resisting the urge to check in on people from my past. It means staying away from things that triggered my addiction. This is very hard for me because it takes a very strong will. I'll show you the example I have in mind. The show Marco Polo on Netflix. I watched the first season before I got married. It was an awesome show. It was a little gory and it had some nudity, which honestly, I could do without. As a result, now that I'm married, I haven't watched it. There are two triggers there. Number one, if my wife and I get into an argument about the nudity it will cause issues. Number two, the nudity itself COULD trigger me. Now this isn't always the case.

"Losing the trigger that makes me turn to pot addiction is a task that was much easier written than done. I had to really work hard, and I still do have to work hard to keep it away. To lose a trigger, I had to first understand that my addiction was a byproduct of pain and stress and possibly anxiety. My addiction comforted me. When I should have been turning to other things to comfort me, my addiction had already weaseled its way closest to me, and it was as if I had no other choice but to go with it instead of church or family or sports. Another thing to watch out for is not to let the triggers of stress and/or pain depress me too much. The reason: this is part of my own personal cycle where if I am trying to escape, I can get caught up in it yet again. Now, I can't control when someone dies or when work gets tough.

It's like getting a free can of coke out of the vending machine when you only a dollar in your name. You happily take the coke, but you know you don't need another. Do I buy another one? It'd be awful easy. Dealing with trigger pointers is very prevalent in overcoming pot addiction, particularly early on. But as I have went on, the urge has decreased more and more, and as a result they aren't nearly as intense.

"Shrinking that big bullseye on your back is a challenge for any addict. Figuring out how to keep away from pot was and is still, sometimes, a challenge. But by shrinking my triggers, I found some hope. Something helpful that comes to mind for me is not allowing myself to be too swept up into emotions. Now, I have to be careful about this. Because I began watching pot because of a lack of emotion, I can't go too far. I did start, after all, because I didn't believe sex and emotion had anything to do with one another because of what I saw and perceived. But in order to shrink my trigger, I can't let just any sudden change in my life derail everything. Even positive events that happen suddenly could make me feel so happy that I'd want to continue that happiness by falling back into habit. I mean it'll last longer, right!? By the same token, those negative life events that are usually the catalyst also have to be dealt with, so this is a delicate balance.","INNER / SELF / balance,MINDSET / obstacles & challenge,HARDSHIP,RESILIENCE / reaction & behavior","Trigger Auditor,I-examiner - reactions & behavior,Challenge Ninja,Adversity Avenger,Problem Primer",POT,Jack,male
" Once I identified my specific pot triggers (they are going to be various and numerous but different for each person), my next step was to track those triggers. I can honestly say that I didn't write this stuff down or type it or record it in any way. I wish I had. I wish I had it to show you. I have pages and pages of workout notes, but none with this sort of information. To be able to look back at my progress would be downright rewarding, so that's just a thought from a mind-logger. I tend to do that all too often. At any rate, I tracked when my triggers occurred, their severity, and how long they lasted. Sometimes the triggers were short. I was either too busy or they weren't all that appealing to me. Other times, they were long and drawn out, and they had me very antsy. They did start to make a pattern. And oftentimes they occurred in moments of complete solitude, telling me I had to have it. Tracking my triggers helped me move forward toward refusing to give into them. Another huge factor for me is tracking my sleep, which I found was a part of my addiction. If I slept well, I wasn't as empty-minded, and I had a much better chance at resisting my triggers.","MINDSET / Clear headed,TRIGGERS / tools & techniques,INNER / SELF / awareness","Trigger Auditor,I-Examiner,Self awareness / habits & behavior,Reactions Auditor,Pattern Interrupter",POT,Jack,male
"After I identified my triggers, each and every specific one, and they were numerous, and tracked them to see when, where, how, and even why they occurred, I could being to try and transcend them. This is much easier said than done, and was one of the most difficult things I had to do. In this, I am trying my absolute hardest to rid myself of pot addiction. Getting to this point is already a major victory for me, but I don't stop here because my work is incomplete. To transcend those triggers, I had to find ways to avoid them. Ways to go around them. Not ways to run from the problem, rather these were ways to resolve the problem(s) in a healthy manner. This is much easier said than done, and it can get troubling, but once I have reached this point it's hard to get depressed. For example to transcend a trigger, I could go talk to someone. Let it all out. I could talk about anything. Being out of my room was a great start, after all. Transcending it just one showed me something big. Once I got here, I knew I had a stable support system in place, and that I could do it.","TRIGGERS / confidence & strength,WARNINGS / Avoid triggers,GROWTH / successes,BABY STEPS / Accomplishments","Trigger Trespasser,The Successcalator,Problem Primer,VULNERABILITY / support from others",POT,Jack,male
"Learning how to transform my triggers into positive things, thoughts, and activities- and not toward feeding my addiction to pot- was a very scary thing to do. In order to do this, I had to walk right up to the belly of the beast. I had to confront those thoughts and feelings that led me to fall. But in doing so, I learned how to transform. I learned how to overcome. I learned, for example, that instead of thinking about my anxiety over pot, that I should think about it is a blessing to come. That came true in the form of my wife. I also take the trigger to physically “take care of myself” and transform it by working out. This is also a physical activity, and it is one that can tire you out, so it became a way to transform my triggers into something good and positive for me. Furthermore, I took the trigger of pain and loss of various family members, friends, and friendships/relationships, and looked back in an appreciative manner. I thanked God that I had the chance to spend time with them for the time I did, and I became thankful for the things that I learned that helped me become a better person. I know it is tough to be a “glass half full” person. I fought it for many years, and I think that's ultimately the reason I became a pot addict. But looking at the world in a positive manner makes a ton of difference in your life.

"I remember having to face the truth of my pot addiction. I mean totally having to face the truth of it. Knowing that I'd have this the rest of my entire life was and is still is downright scary. There will always be that temptation to look toward other things and to smoking. And that is very hard and it is depressing. My wife knows. Telling her and the other maybe handful of people ever sucked. I don't take that word lightly. It's not a professional word, but it conveys my desperate point. Knowing all of the time I squandered also makes me hurt deep down inside because I can't get that back. But in that is the beauty of this. This is my past. I can't change that. But I can make sure it doesn't control my future, no matter how hard the obstacles are. I can talk to people, who are numerous and everywhere. We all have a support system nowadays via the internet. I happen to have a great one at home. I am very lucky with that. I can have confidence-not arrogance- that I can move past my previous life.

"Putting the shoe on the other foot is always a great way to make sure that I see things from the perspective of others. This is also, in my estimation, the golden rule. This is how I believe we all should live. Something that I have found helpful in my life is to put one the shoe of someone else and look at myself. Of course, I know my secrets that others don't but just bare with me. If someone else knew I was a pot addict, that I wasted countless hours, that I couldn't escape this, what would they think of me? What would my friends, family, potential employers think? When I lift the hood from myself, I was plain disgusting. I received little to no joy from this addiction, yet I couldn't stop myself. But this, this represented a chance to look at myself in a new way. Maybe I could see myself as others see me. As just another person. Maybe I could let it go for once, and then move past it. I could see myself as others would- a clean slate, tabula rasa, and I would take advantage of this second opportunity by doing what I want with my life. By spending my time better, by helping others, by looking more positively on myself and my life in general.

"Up and down. Hot and cold. On and off. That's how I felt on many days. Did I or do I really want to stop and/or stay stopped? Do I want this pot addiction to stop having control over me so that I can have control over it? Some days the answer was an emphatic yes for me. Other days were very difficult. I didn't want to do anything but go back to my comforts. And that comfort was smoking for a couple of hours. For me, this is one of the worst and most depressing parts of being a pot addict. I have to face the question every moment of every day because I don't seem to ever forget. I never fully escape the sensations. I have to concentrate so hard on what I'm doing in the moment. While this is no doubt depressing, it is also a signal that I am pointed into the right direction because I am now thinking about stopping, and that is only a good thing for me.

"The advantage of having a pot addiction (there aren't very many), is that I don't necessarily have as much of a chemical dependency on the activity as a substance abuser would. While I do have urges, and I do want that euphoric high, or that comfort to fall back on, it isn't so much a chemical imbalance that makes me feel bad. This makes it more about me controlling my urges. This gives me a chance to stop what I'm doing and get help from a whole myriad of options. The chance I have is to take my emotions and my stress and to talk about it and let it out. That's the reason I wanted to share this with you. This is therapeutic. I can open up. There is absolutely no shame in talking about problems. I used to believe that I had to be the one that had it all together. I was the guy that got the soccer scholarship with straight A's. I was the college graduate. I was the man in the middle of the divorce holding my family together, so I thought. I was supposed to have this perfect image, and thus I couldn't talk about my problems because they were somehow less than the people around me. In the age of the internet, there is absolutely zero excuse for this phenomenon. It was all too easy for me to smoke for pot for hours, but I couldn't search for even an anonymous chat room or a group or forum to help myself? Learning that taking any of these steps to deal with these emotions is better for me than smoking pot was a very large step into the right direction.

"When I was a kid, my mom had a quote she always told me and even had posted. It was something like “life is ten percent what happens to me, and ninety percent how I react to it.” That was Charles Swindoll, by the way. My attitude is what I want it to be. How I react is ultimately up to me. While my pot addiction is a disease, it did start somewhere. While I can't block urges, I can learn how to cope with them by having an attitude of positivity. If I can in to the situation where I encounter an urge with a depressed, or even, a sarcastic type of attitude, I will have a much more difficult time combating my urge. If I walk out on to the field for a game and I believe I am going to lose, the chances are that I'm going to lose. Part of overcoming my addiction is by being happy, or at least more positive, and trying to have an outlook on life that says “I can do this!”","OPTIMISM,SELF ESTEEM / beliefs,MINDSET / Perceptions","I-Can-ographer,THOUGHTS / positivity,Attitude Alchemizer,Urge Purger",POT,Jack,male
"One of my favorite silly movies is The Replacements. It's basically a comedy with one great, serious scene about fear. They ask what each person is afraid of. They say all kinds of stuff. To name your fears is tough. I tend to mask mine, to just about half truths about them. I will say that I'm afraid of losing. Or that I'm afraid of being alone. But really I am afraid of failure. That is my overarching fear. I am afraid of failing in anything. It is really hard for me to say that. To be vocal is tough. So, to own up and name off that I have the urge to get high is huge. It doesn't mean that I am a terrible person. To the contrary, I am saying to someone-or myself- that I have the urge and that I need help. This is glorious because it lets that person know that I want help and I want you to be there with me. I have done this in my life to people I had close relationships with. And this made all of those relationships better and closer because of my transparency and willingness to name my urges.","TRUTH / self honesty,VULNERABILITY / learning and mistakes,URGES / support & help","Blunder Blesser,SELF HARM / Self honesty & admit,VULNERABILITY / support from others,Urge Namerizer",POT,Jack,male
"I hate resisting urges. I love to drink Sprite. I love to eat candy on occasion. I (used) to love to smoke pot. Yep, I did. At least for a short time before it became just an addiction. It's very tough for me to say no. The Sprite makes me gain weight and it slows me down. The candy does the same and it eats up my wallet. It's easy, in comparison, to give up those two. But my pot addiction is harder. Because it is an addiction. It is tough. It is a crutch. It is something I want and sometimes need. Or at least I feel like it. And reality is my perception of it. So resisting urges is hard for me. The bright spot I see when I do resist an urge, even if it only lasts a little while, is that I am telling myself that this hurts everything in my life. It hurts, no ruins, my social life, and I want one worse than anything. That is my hope. I don't want to ever hurt my wife again, and I would never and have never done it on purpose. I haven't said to myself “she’s boring I need to seek something else.” That's never been what pot was about for me. It was about finding something where I fit in. It was about being able to finally have a “self acceptance.” Not that it really was. And while all of that was a lie, an illusion, it made me feel good and it helped for a short time. Resisting the urge of comfort is the thing that I am most worried about. Because it is the easy thing to do now for me. It's very easy. Comfort is easy. Laying on a nice, soft bed is easy. That's pot. But to lay down on the bed of thumbtacks that is life without pot gives you a new perspective, and it soon makes you realize that you're actually in a pretty good place.

"Urges are very similar to waves we see on the ocean. They come and go. They are up and down. They vary between intensities. Some move me great amount, others move me very little. With my pot addiction, I can help myself avoid the urge by “surfing” through it. This is a very difficult technique because it takes me to the gate of my urges. But if I do it correctly, I can surf through my urge. I think about the sensations that come with smoking pot. As I smoke what do I feel? In truth, very little. I think about this and think is this really what I am missing? That's not that much. I can do this. I think about the momentary euphoria that I get when I'm finished, yeah that's OK. But soon after, and I mean SOON after- like directly- I start to feel ashamed as I trudge away. I think to myself again, is this really something I need or even want? By doing this, sometimes for up to 30 minutes at a time I can outlast my urges and move past them to accomplish the things I want to in life.
