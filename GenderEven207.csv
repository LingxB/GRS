"Throughout my drinking career, instant gratification was the norm. I wanted what I wanted, and I wanted it all, right now! I have learned that almost everything I do comes in baby steps. I have to remember that when I first learned how to walk, I didn’t just wake up one day and walk perfectly, it took time. Now, as I work towards goals, taking baby steps is okay with me, for a couple of reasons. Firstly, baby steps slow me down and give me time to decide if my course of action is really what I want. Secondly, by slowing down and being deliberate, I can better master what I’m doing – instead of being a jack of all trades, master of none, I can be a master of what I set my mind to doing.","PROGRESS / start small,INNER MASTERY / take a step back,BABY STEPS / slow changes","Baby Step Embracer,Finish Line Forgetter,The Mindfulizer,Inner Greatness Greeter,WAIT AND SWITCH / Small steps",DRUGS/ALC,Paul,male

"The bipolar coaster was one hell of a ride. It would bounce back and forth from exciting and euphoric, to terrifying and miserable. I rode this coaster for years - with a bipolar girlfriend to complement it. With my drug-induced mood swings and her diagnosed mania, amplified by our addiction, the bipolar coaster became the most unstable vehicle to drag us through our lives. I saw happy people from the view atop the bipolar coaster. I was certain they were faking it. Nobody could be happy constantly - not if I couldn't. These people were bound to find misery soon, I thought, just as the coaster swung me into a paradoxical state of euphoria. After I lost my friends and my girlfriend, I had time to think to myself about who I used to be. I remembered thatI had been happy. I had felt joy and excitement before – my friends had too. And it had lasted! Amazing! Where had that joy gone? I guess I'd smoked it. I wanted to get off this coaster because it was ruining my chance to be happy, so I went through detox.

"The truth is something that an addict likes to hide from, and this only made me grow more and more bitter. Through denial, lies, and the mask I constantly wore to protect (or hide from) myself, I couldn't hope to know who I really was. As my addiction spiraled downwards, though, telltale signs became obvious. What I should have known from the beginning was only told to me when I saw the derelict life I had driven myself into.

" I lived in the dark for a long time. With only the flame on my lighter to guide me, I was a lonely, drug-addicted bottom feeder. I liked it, though - it was just me and the dope, nobody to bother us - except my girlfriend. Having a relationship as a junkie is hard, and one week when things were getting particularly stressful, I woke up to find the apartment trashed. My girlfriend had taken her most important things and the next thing I heard from her was a text message telling me she was on a plane across the country. Plot twist. This brightened my brain to the reality of the situation - my apartment was trashed, I had gotten fired, my truck got impounded - I wasn't going anywhere.

I was so confident in my cerebral activity that I decided doing drugs would be a good idea. So sure of myself, I didn't realize that I was doing damage to myself and my others. I didn't need to change a thing – I was just doing drugs because I enjoyed them. They made me more creative, more productive... it was great! For a while. The initial benefits wore off quick though, and I found myself in a spiral of addiction that lasted several years. This spiral sucked the roof from over my head, the friends from my life, the love from my relationships. I was left with nothing but myself and my corrupted brain, and I realized that I needed a reboot. I'd been doing things wrong. The only way I could reboot my brain was by going through rehab, so I did.

"As an addict, I burned a lot of bridges – good and bad. In the first couple years of addictions, I burned bridges with my close friends, my loved ones – even parts of myself. Eventually, though, I had no bridges left to burn but the one with myself and my drug dealers. I chose to burn the one that connected me to drugs. Through a vigorous detox, I burnt all the bridges with my dealers and my drug-addicted friends. I came out clean and sober, and this gave me the tools I needed to build back the bridges I'd burnt. It took quite a while – my friends were so distant now that they were apprehensive about putting the work in to rebuild a bridge that I'd so callously destroyed.

"Since childhood, I wanted to burn as few bridges as possible. Even during disagreements with friends, I realized that completely separating from them would destroy chances for future good times. I made sure my bridges stood strong enough to withstand the ages - until I got into drugs. I wish I hadn't shattered as many relationships as I had, but my motives were fogged by my addiction. I simply couldn't have a stable relationship, because my intimate connection with dope always had to come first. My friends knew this, and once it became apparent that my dope was my priority, a lot of people chose not to talk to me. As my friends faded from my life, I soon found myself completely alone. I had burnt the wrong bridges – and the only way I could build up what I'd lost was to burn the right ones. I'd burnt bridges of close friends and family, when really I should have destroyed those of drug dealers and fellow addicts. This needed to stop, otherwise I'd be an addict for the rest of my life. With all the strength I could muster, I set fire to the connections that adhered me to the life of an addict. I left the shambles of my life behind, watching flames consume the bridges I crossed to meet my dealers.

"I was born with a clean slate – everyone is. Through emotional scars, arguments, toxic  relationships – that slate gets a few smudges on it. That's normal. The most destructive choice I made in life, though, was to start doing drugs. I didn't know that I'd dirtied my slate, because I loved what I was doing. I was getting high – all the time. I was an addict.

I needed a clean slate. The only way I could do that was with sobriety, so I went to detox. I scrubbed all the dirt and damage off my slate during a rigorous period of withdrawal. It hurt – I was scrubbing off things that I believed were part of myself. Still, when I was finished – when I had my clean slate – life looked a lot brighter. It was beautiful!

"I might say... I've been a bit stingy with money. Not selfish, but stingy – I'd always buy the bottom-of-the-barrel drinks, the cheapest of used clothes. I'd prefer to spend money on experience, not materials, and I was always weighing the cost to the benefit of the thing I'd be buying. Things were, ultimately, only things - and a snazzy shirt with a logo that cost a hundred bucks wouldn't benefit me nearly as much as fourty bucks of gas, a case of beer, a propane stove and a couple steaks to roast on a weekend campout. One thing that struck my fancy early-on was the cost-benefit of marijuana. For five bucks, I could explore the inner workings of my mind for hours. I invested time and money in it at a young age, and this opened me up to a world of drugs. I got addicted, hard, and fast. Soon I was doing heroin daily - and a junkie like myself is truly the expert of cost-benefit. I'd count the gas for my truck out in change - ""$1.47 in tank 3, please,"" just so I'd have enough left over to buy a pinhead sized bit of dope. This, of course, was only after calling two or three people to find out what kind they had, their prices, and how many people I could find to pitch in so we could save money. The cost was higher than I thought, though - even though I paid for the dope with money, I paid for the addiction with my life. I lost my house, my friends, my girl - everything. What was the benefit? I got to be high. Somehow, this benefit over-weighed all these losses - until I was left alone, getting evicted by a violent landlord, with nobody to talk to but my parents. I could either sit there and get beat up, or call my mom and beg her to take me to detox. The latter option seemed much better. I took this improved cost-analysis 'skill' with me, though, and even though I work hard - I'm still able to buy a week's worth of groceries for two people with ten bucks.","SOBRIETY / costs & benefits,TRUTH / dark past,DEAD END","Lack Hacker,Black Hole Blesser,Dead End Defier ,RAW SOUL REVEALER / costs,Lost Benefit Lamenter",DRUGS/ALC,Nigel,male

"Two wrongs doesn't make a right. I've been taught that since elementary. I was always emotionally distraught – battling anxiety, depression, and insecurity. These things aren't wrong, but they certianly aren't right – and I chose to battle them with something that I now know was wrong – drugs. I fell into a bad addiction, and dope began to run my life. Because of my addiction with dope, I hurt a lot of my friends and family. Instead of dealing with the repercussions of these wrongs, I'd cover up my responsibility with more drugs – another double wrong. This cycle kept amplifying itself until I had nobody left to do wrong to – except myself. Doing wrong to myself in an empty apartment with no girlfriend and no friends made me realize how stupid I'd been. I had to do right, for once – but I couldn't do that in the hold of drug addiction. Before I could do right, I had to go to rehab – so I did. I began to regain my sense of self, and my sense of morale. Since I've been sober, I've tried my hardest to do right for everyone I come into contact with – and life's been great since.","COMMUNITY / healthy relationships,ACCOUNTABILITY / damage confess,CHANGE / mental confidence","Double Wronger,Values VIP’r,Dire Extinguisher,Responsibility Baby Stepper,Relationship Dedamager",DRUGS/ALC,Nigel,male
"Regulating my emotions wasn't really something I focused on early in life. I consider this a detriment, because when I got into drugs, they got out of control. Addiction rattled me – I had little sense of how I was acting, endowed with a sense of superiority and moral perfection that the drugs forced me to believe. I would lash out at my friends, and they would try to regulate me – but, of course, I refused. Nothing could regulate me except drugs – so I thought – but they just made the problemworse. When I lost everything, I realized it was time to check myself. I needed to regulate my own emotions, and the only way I could do that was by going sober. I went to detox, and as each day of withdrawal passed, I became more under control of my own feelings. Now, sober, I'm able to diffuse negativity before it strikes – and I'm able to spot triggers for other people and help them calmly evade negative situations before they allow themselves to get consumed.","EMOTIONS,NEGATIVITY,GROWTH / supporting myself","Emotions Engineer,WAIT AND SWITCH / Emotions,Negativity Nuker,CLOSET CONFESSOR / Share & support",DRUGS/ALC,Nigel,male

I was feeding myself poisonous substances and dangerous situations, and my life onlymetabolized them into excrement. My existence became excrement. I kept hoping I could change it, but when my experiential diet consisted of drugs and anger, the only thing I offered the world was just that. Excrement. I grew tired of being surrounded by such a smelly existence. Everything had disappeared from my life - friendship, value, feelings. I wanted a change of pace, so I made the hardest choice of my life - I flushed it down the toilet. Everything I'd grown attached to - drugs, the rush, even the sickness held a place in my heart.

Since I went through a much more extreme period, fabricating excuses to save me from jail and violence instead of angry moms, missed homework seems silly. I got addicted to drugs, but I never wanted to admit that I was an addict. I'd give myself any excuse to use - I had a small headache, my stubbed toe hurt, maybe I'd get anxious.

Well - I didn't run out of excuses, but I ran out of vigor because I started seeing that something was actually wrong. Excuses didn't proliferate my non-existent rent money. I began to look deeper, and I exposed my excuses for what they were. I was an addict, and I needed help. No more excuses. I got help, and I made it through detox.

Unfortunately, after a high school project, my feelings about drugs flipped and I decided it'd be a good idea to try them. For the next few years, I was an addict, though I'd completely flipped a lot of my feelings from what I'd thought even months before my dependency. Friends, so recently sources of comfort and entertainment, were now sources of money. Drugs, a mysterious, stigmatized underworld of substances, were now my motivation for living.

I was able to repair my life when I flipped the most important feeling around - the belief that I wasn't an addict. I had to accept that before I was willing to make a change, and once I did, I went straight to detox.

My friends saw through the facade, though, and I lost most of them quickly. With no friends, I was stuck with my drug-addicted self – and I didn't like it. I had to change something, and I went through detox and realized the true value of paying it forward. I had much to give back to the couple friends who stuck with me through the throes of my addiction, and even to those who had left me early on.

The variables involved in its consideration were a) how I was going to get money, and b) which dealer was closest to my house and had good dope. I sometimes played with the idea of being sober, but it seemed so distant that it wasn't worth dedicating any time to it. Being blind to the future led me into a lot of problems. Since all I cared about was getting drugs for the day, I didn't think nearly enough about rent payments, job schedules, or maintaining relationships.

I still couldn't delay my gratification - I needed drugs NOW, or people would have to deal with my irritability. At this point, I became aware that delaying gratification made things better - if I had to wait too long for my dope, I'd get sick, and the rush would be better when I finally picked up. Still, this wasn't a real benefit until I got sober and cleaned up. Once my addiction blew up and I found myself homeless and friendless, I realized that the only gratification I could get would be from quitting the dope - and that was a rough process.

Throwing my life in the gutter shone some light to reveal my inner layers - the scared, addicted child I was, living in a man's body. I wanted myself back, so I forced myself into detox and came out clean. The revelations that followed this were incredible - it was like being born again.

"Taking my inner inventory was never a priority. I was who I was. I never gave it much thought, despite being insecure as a teenager. My insecurities were simply a part of me, but I didn't take notes about when they arose or why they were there. This was part of the reason I got into drugs, and became very addicted. My friends checked my inventory and found that there was less and less everyday. My external inventory, also, was lacking - I sold things, lost cars, eventually got evicted. I had nothing left but myself. This is when I started taking inventory on myself. What skills had I lost? What values were missing? What did I have that I used to be proud of that had since gone out of stock? These sorts of questions led me to realize that I had nothing left, and if I wanted to start checking off any sort of respectable inner inventory list, I had to clean up my act.

Regardless of the truth behind this definition, this described my life as a junkie. I was convinced , every night, that I'd finally done the last of my dope.

"Irrationality's always shared a love-hate relationship with me. I'm a pretty silly guy, and I love to make absurd jokes and wave my arms unnecessarily at strangers. Still, I respect rationality - strong, integral decision making skills backed by logic and common sense. The first time I neglected my own rational belief system was when I started drugs. I (irrationally) reasoned that it would be a good experience for me to explore the world of psychoactive chemicals. It was not, but I forced myself to believe that it was. I became addicted quickly, and the addiction seemed to create my beliefs: if I followed a rational belief – knowing that I was hurting myself, my friends, my family - the addiction would have ended because I'd go sober. It wouldn't let me. When the world had crumbled and left me with nobody around except the incessant voice of my addiction, I began to argue against it. After all - a broken down junkie with no friends, who hated the world - I had nobody else to argue with. I disputed its stupid irrational beliefs and decided it was a good idea for me to go to detox, so I did.

"I was always guided by instinct – whether or not I knew it. Any living organism is – it's how life survived this long. Instinct, essentially, guided me towards drugs – and drugs overrode my insinctual tendencies. I began refusing my actual instinct. My addiction became my instinct, and I was guided only towards drugs. It felt natural – it felt like instinct – but my true instinct was begging for me to stop. I wouldn't listen to it, though. I'd allowed my dependency to invent my new instinct. This new guiding force led me nowhere but to a depressive, homeless, friendless existence. It was here that my old instinct began making itself known again. Something had to change – and since I'd lost everything, the only thing I could change was myself. I hesitantly took the recommendation of my new instinct and led myself to rehab. From here, the 'false instinct' that the addiction had bestowed on me began to dissolve, and I felt my true needs resurface. I needed to be clean – it was the only way that I could be myself.

"Life's a journey, and I've always loved that. Any step taken alters the course of the future, the people I meet, the treasures I'd find. I always needed progress, be it through building talent, knowledge, relationships, or experiences. When I first tried drugs, I considered my journey to be taking a huge step in the right direction. For the first time, I felt comfortable enough in my own skin to talk to people at a party. I felt comfortable expressing my feelings. I even picked up a guitar and gave it a couple strums. My journey had been stagnant, I thought - drugs were the map to a better future! I'd say most addicts are similar at the start. I was invincible. It was simply not possible that I'd get addicted. I only used the drugs to progress the journey of life. This changed over the years though, and as my addiction progressed, the journey through life fell short. I still convinced myself that I was progressing - I'd write a poem now and then, when I wasn't hating everyone, or I'd write a couple riffs on the guitar. I was so stuck in the current moment - never moving forward on my quest - that I didn't acknowledge how much faster I'd be going if I was sober. It took an eviction, a breakup, and a dozen friends ditching me to make me realize that my journey had now taken me backwards. With the last steps I could muster, I crawled to detox and managed to forgive myself for straying from the path.

I was called a lot of things that I won't list here, and tried to fit into far too many contradicting cliques. When I graduated, I'd grown quite popular – and when I graduated, I erased all those labels because I realized the kids who judged me for them – be it the stoned loser or the funny popular kid – were too preoccupied with someone else's life than their own, and if I just ignored labeling anyone, my life would be much more productive. Unfortunately, around the same time, I got addicted to heroin. It wasn't an overnight thing, but the process was a steady rockslide.

For me, it was a nightly thing - I'd fall asleep promising myself that I'd wake up and go clean, then I'd wake up and call my dealer once the sickness reminded me how powerless I was. This cycle kept me down for six years. I'd wake up, get my fix, promise that I'd start working towards getting sober and cutting back. That night, I'd analyze how much dope I'd done and either congratulate myself for doing less, or cajole myself for doing more - either way, ending with ""then you deserve to go clean."" I never remembered in the morning, though. As I kept fueling this cycle, I lost more and more of my life to the cost of drugs. My house fell apart, I got evicted. My friends ditched me. Even my girlfriend, who'd been with me for most of my addiction left me alone in our empty apartment. I sat there that night, her leftover clothes and the pictures she'd painted strewn about the floor, hearing the text message that I stared at, slack jawed. It was telling me over and over, in her voice, that she'd boarded a plane and was already halfway across the country. This time, when I told myself that it was my last binge - I knew I spoke the truth. I didn't even need to promise - in that instant, I had already quit.

My sober self was no longer me - I was a sick, lethargic mess with enough energy only to call my dealer or message folk on facebook and beg to borrow money. I was pathetic. Getting a hit of dope still zapped the laziness, but it never helped the problem. I was procrastinating over something different now - my need to go sober. What it took to zap my mental laziness was a whole lot of suffering. As I watched my roommates move out on me, my girlfriend fly across the country, and myself get evicted, I still remained lethargic and useless.

The addition of hard drugs made me not just a lazy thinker, but a lethargic one. My IQ dropped twenty points on a standard test, but I was too slow of a thinker to even realize how I'd changed.

Certainly nobody had driven me – I had. My own self-directed negativity had led me into this destructive pit, and I'd sat there festering in my own negative thoughts. I was able to monitor my thoughts now, and they were all negative. This had to stop, so I went to detox. During detox, I watched the way my mind worked. It was pessimistic and made me feel like a victim. I changed this quickly, monitoring and isolating the negativity and replacing it with happiness. As a sober young man, now, my negative thought monitor is fully functional and helps me eradicate any malevolence before it effects my life.","NEGATIVITY,INNER / SELF / awareness,CHANGE / thoughts,INNER MASTERY / tools & processes","Negativity Negotiator,RAW SOUL REVEALER / thoughts,Self Awareness Awakener,Attitude Alchemizer",DRUGS/ALC,Nigel,male
"When I was a junkie, I did manage to take a few breaks - a month here, six months once - but relapses were inevitable. I had never truly wanted to stop using dope - I had wanted not to be an addict. This makes a huge difference - like a lot of addicts, I quit because I feared the damage the drug was doing... but I still wanted the drug itself. This cycle repeated for years. My last binge lasted almost three. At the end of this binge, I connected some dots from different parts of my life and came to realize that every significant problem I'd had in the last six years - relationships, housing, vehicle issues - had, in some way, been related to drugs. Sitting on the floor of my house with no mattress and two roommates who had just left me, I knew that this would keep happening if I let myself keep relapsing. That was the first moment I truly wanted to stop doing drugs. That day, I ditched most of what I owned in the apartment and checked into detox. I had no desire to ever use again - not because I didn't enjoy the drug, but because the repercussions were obvious to me now, and I knew they would never change I'm sure I'm still an addict – just an addict that has no desire to relapse.","WARNINGS / Relapse & tools,COMMITMENTS,MINDSET / no matter what","Lapse Lessonizer,Killer Kickstarter,Addiction AMF’r,COMMITMENT knitter / above all else",DRUGS/ALC,Nigel,male
"I was never in a rush to get anywhere as a kid. Go with the flow – embrace situations as they come to you. The choice to do drugs was a situation that arose, and I embraced it eagerly. With my first toke of marijuana, a clock started ticking. The closer it got to zero hour, the more addicted I got. I was so high that I didn't bother tracking this time – instead, I kept going with the flow, even though it was feeding me into the depths of addiction. My friends had long since gauged enough time to have passed for them to leave me. When I lost my girlfriend and my house, I had nothing left but the ticking of the damnable clock. I realized that if it hit zero hour, I was going to be addicted for life – so I made a change. I tracked time, finally, and saw that I had none left. I had to go to detox. After a painful withdrawal, I found myself with a reset clock. Now, it only ticks down towards good moments – experiences to share with friends, dates I'm going to travel. On top of that – I have so much more time now, that tracking it leaves me with nothing but a smile when I realize that I have so much more life to experience.","COMMITMENTS,MINDSET / Future sobriety,BABY STEPS / slow changes","Lost Benefit Lamenter,WAIT AND SWITCH / Small steps,Progress Pollinator,COMMITMENT knitter / laziness & effort",DRUGS/ALC,Nigel,male

"I have learned that cold turkey quitting is one of the hardest things to do in life. My dad is addicted to cigarettes, and I saw him as a young pre-teen trying to go “cold turkey.” With tobacco, most doctors don't even suggest doing this all at once. For pot users, we have a bit of a different dilemma as what we are doing has no way to be tampered down. One session, if you will, can cause months of setbacks and feelings that take so long to suppress (I feel as if I will never fully forget pot). The activity can't be reduced by half and then half again. I can't try and do it just once a week. It's still my crutch. It's still going to bring me right back to my lowest low if I do it just once. While that temptation is always going to be there, I know that making a clean break will be best for me and my family.","MINDSET / no matter what,ABSTINENCE,INNER MASTERY / challenge & resilience","Cold Turkey Taster,Killer Kickstarter,COMMITMENT knitter / above all else,Temperance Tester",POT,Jack,male
"I've seen many types of compulsions in my life. Some of them are good, many of them are bad. Compulsions, in and of themselves, are not bad. My compulsions, though, are bad when they control me. Figuring out how to control my urge to get high is a step in the right direction. Unlike my dog expecting to be fed after going outside in the morning, I am capable of controlling my impulses. It is NEVER easy and there is lots of self-doubt and fear, but with it I know I can control my compulsion. I can differentiate between having no control of a situation and being out of control. I absolutely love to be in control. I am a classic controller. I was team captain. I was always in charge of projects at school. I am now a coach and can't stand when someone doesn't listen to me word-for-word. So pot was a way for me to have control. But little did I know that it actually was taking control of me! So it is here that is my starting point: I let go of the things I can't control and free myself of that burden, which helps me lose the burden of my addiction.

"NOT avoiding conflict became very important to me as a I struggled to escape the bondage of my pot addiction. There was major conflict in my life that caused me to see the world in a very warped way. What I saw was a cold, callused world that had no cares or emotions. As such, I manifested that by doing something that for all intents and purposes that had no emotion to it. It was simply action. I tried to solve conflict at first by becoming a “referee” in the divorce of my parents. I tried to bring everyone together. Then I began to let more and more conflicts lead me down further and further into my personal hole. Avoiding conflict is not the answer, rather knowing how to deal with it is how I was able to take a step in the right direction. I just can't bottle this up, I can't bottle up my emotions like I am thoughtless or some tough warrior- men have emotions to- or I will let it out all at once in a huge relapse of epic proportions. It is important to make that point one more time. I HAVE EMOTIONS! I may handle them better than my wife, I may not be as jealous as she is. But I do get jealous. And when I do, I need to talk about those things. If I avoid that conflict, there will be problems. Major problems. But if I can talk, I can alleviate them and get on the right path.

"A girl. A look. A glance. A thought. One instance. Just one thing. Just one word. Just a bad grade or a bad day. That's all it took for me to let my pot addiction take over. It could literally be anything or it could be nothing. Sometimes I wouldn't even want it. I could tell. My body could tell. But I had been triggered by some conflict, or was it my thoughts? I have learned that pot thoughts are very difficult to get rid of. I don't know if I can get rid of them, or if I can just suppress them to be honest. To an extent, they are always there, lingering. So when someone did me wrong, at least in my estimation, I was going to make it all better by locking myself in and smoking pot and forgetting about it. The problem was there when I was done, only I was more insecure, more hurt, and more scarred. I learned to talk out my feelings. I tried to let others know when I was hurt. This vulnerability only aided me, and it showed others that I, too, could use the help or friendship even.

"Taking a moment to explore my thoughts and feelings about where my pot addiction was taking me was always very important. Throughout my entire addiction, I have known and acknowledged consequences. I didn't know all of them, as they are numerous, and I still don't know them all. However, I know there are many that have long-lasting effects. My relationships with others were severely harmed. I was sometimes more late for things that I normally would have been. I felt less confident in myself and my own body. Little things add up, and people know it. I stayed insular, I didn't look for work. By exploring the consequences, I could see who all was hurt by my actions instead of just seeing it as an individual battle. One of the major things that my wife and I had to talk about, and what I want to get out there, is a significant consequence. That being the perception of pot. I will say right now that having smoked pot I did NOT have unrealistic expectations for what life was going to be like. I did not think that it should be like how I felt, and I didn't want it to be that way. I can't speak for other people, but I can say that. However, my wife and other people in my life believed that I expected certain things because of this addiction. As a result, my wife's self-esteem was hurt. She tried to do things that she didn't have to do sometimes. I had to- we had to- work very hard to build up trust in spite of that.

I use it in my everyday life, and I wish I had learned to better use it as a I struggled through pot addiction. I never really thought of applying this to all areas of my life until later, unfortunately, but it is a marvelous way of looking at the world. When I was smoking pot, I wasn't able to socialize. I wasn't able to go find the companionship I desperately craved most. I wasn't able to play soccer, which I love. I wasn't even able to concentrate fully on a game that I wanted to watch. I couldn't even make it through a whole match at times without wanting to smoke pot.

"One of the hardest things I have had to deal with in regards to my pot addiction is the fact that, at its core, it is an urge. I have resisted urges before. Everyone has. So what makes this one difficult and why can't I resist this one? That part makes me downright angry. I start to seem as if I have no control. And that downward spiral doesn't lead to anything good. It usually ends up right back at relapse. Something that has helped me is to accept that urges are normal. Once there, I can “attack” my urges. I can let them bounce off of me. And the beauty of this is that if I can resist one time, then I have a template to do it again. I know I can do it again. Here is where I start to see real progress.

"Simply not being able to control when I get the craving does not make me a failure. Failure is hard for me. It goes hand-in-hand with my addiction. But just because I am addicted to pot and receive a craving to smoke it does not mean I have magically relapsed or that something awful has happened to me. Learning to combat the cravings is much more important. They are coming and they will be painful, whether I want them or not. I do a few things to help control cravings. If I am in a place or doing a certain activity that is causing my cravings, I can leave that place. This is not avoiding it. Rather, I am admitting it is a problem and leaving. I would not leave my little brother on the side of the road if he was in danger, so I am not going to leave myself to get run over, either! Another great way to channel my cravings into something positive is for me to workout.

"Dealing with craving cramps as a pot addict is a cyclical process. This is not as prevalent as it would be for a drug user, for instance, but it is still powerful and has to be overcome. For me, I was usually mindless when I would smoke pot. If I was disengaged, it was much easier for me to slip into smoking. So, when this occurred, particularly in the morning or in the mid-to-late afternoon, or even well after supper, I would be hungry. Hunger is my enemy in my fight. When I don't fuel my body, I lose focus and sharpness. And I would start to hurt. And since I didn't want to have a relationship because of whatever my reason was at the time, I reverted to pot. So, the good part of this one for me was that I knew a great way to combat it. But it did make it very difficult because it seemingly added just another drop into a seemingly insurmountable ocean.

"Ever seen a caffeine or even nicotine addict in need of their product of choice? Much like that, I have had pot cravings that led to crash in the past. Now, these weren't nearly as bad, for me, as most nicotine would be. That is downright cruel in its treatment of people. But I have crashed, if you will. I have craved so badly and wanted it more than anything to the point that no matter how bad I denied it, I would feel terrible. I'd be sick to my stomach, I'd even have headaches. This didn't happen all of the time to me, but they did occur. They made me want to just give up and always live with my addiction as it was. These usually happened when I encountered someone or something from my past that was either very painful. They were specific, but they were strong. Now, if I was able to overcome this craving, I learned how to overcome for the first time.

"Very simply, “curb” means to restrain. To restrain, and to then refrain, is my ultimate goal. I don't want to continue to be powerless in the face of my comforting pot addiction. So one of the things I learned was to curb my cravings. This, like most of the other things I have learned, is easier said than done. To restrain my cravings meant to remove myself from negativity and my potential triggers. I don't simply run from my problems, however. If there are stresses or conflicts with people, I need to deal with those. Sometimes, I may need to leave a job or a school for my own good. I can't expect to take my addiction out of the equation when I continue to do everything I was doing (sans smoking pot) before! It is in this that I saw some results instantly. I couldn't expect to sit in my room, alone, with the door locked, with the lights on, in the same position as always, and expect to do anything other than smoking pot.

This helped me reduce my cravings because, generally, I was around people that were in the same situations.

"Witnessing one of my own cravings was and is a very harrowing experience. It could come at just about anything. A memory is usually the catalyst, however. A memory from the “old days” of when I was watching pot regularly. Maybe even a memory from when I was dating someone. How I felt about them. How I wanted them at the time. Maybe sometimes just the name being dropped would cause this for me. And instantly my brain just remembers and bam. I'm feeling anticipation in that very moment and I want to run back to those feelings. When the craving does subside, I feel the love of my wife and appreciation I have for her. I feel this the OVERWHELMING part of the time, but I know that the cravings are there. And it can get depressing, especially when I am haunted by my past. I can't go back and change those things. I can't meet her sooner. But I can form a closer bond to her, or to a friend. It doesn't have to be a certain person. It can be any number of things. But I draw hope from the fact that if I overcome this craving, this memory, that I now know how to do it and that I can do it again. She has also witnessed this, which is heartbreaking for me. I've had to tell her that I had thoughts, to try to explain to my wife why I would even think about watching pot is awful. But she is my best friend, and I have to rely on her.

"Throughout the years of my pot addiction, I have been able to see patterns and cycles form. Initially, I started it just because I enjoyed it. But soon after, it became a crutch for me. I had a hard time getting over the divorce of my parents. In turn, I felt like there wasn't true “love,” and that I'd just never find it anyway. So that led to my addiction. As things continued to seemingly spiral out of control to me, I began to use every difficult situation in my life as an excuse or a reason to watch. Soon, I began to hate myself for watching. That caused a cycle of despair that ended us, you guessed it: watching pot. But there was a silver lining: at least I knew that this was happening to me, that it was a crutch.

Not just for them but for me. I had to let myself off the hook for the past, as I could not change what I had done. I had to apologize to people for the way I thought of them or treated them.

"Some people in today's world would rather avoid triggers than even acknowledge them. I don't like to hear negative things about me or my loved ones, my beliefs, or my actions. However, avoiding them doesn't mask the fact that they happen. I know they happen, and I must accept it and know that it is a part of my life. My pot addiction can't be kicked simply by avoiding all adversity in life. The reason why is this: when I smoke pot, I am locked up alone; when I avoid triggers, I am alone. I am already more than half way toward going back to my addiction. I must acknowledge my trigger and meet it as best as I can by looking it in the face and saying no. What this means is resisting the urge to check in on people from my past. It means staying away from things that triggered my addiction. This is very hard for me because it takes a very strong will. I'll show you the example I have in mind. The show Marco Polo on Netflix. I watched the first season before I got married. It was an awesome show. It was a little gory and it had some nudity, which honestly, I could do without. As a result, now that I'm married, I haven't watched it. There are two triggers there. Number one, if my wife and I get into an argument about the nudity it will cause issues. Number two, the nudity itself COULD trigger me. Now this isn't always the case.

Eliminating triggers that I can control is good for me, and is something I do to keep myself sane. I decide to watch shows and movies that my wife and I can enjoy, or sports.

"Losing the trigger that makes me turn to pot addiction is a task that was much easier written than done. I had to really work hard, and I still do have to work hard to keep it away. To lose a trigger, I had to first understand that my addiction was a byproduct of pain and stress and possibly anxiety. My addiction comforted me. When I should have been turning to other things to comfort me, my addiction had already weaseled its way closest to me, and it was as if I had no other choice but to go with it instead of church or family or sports. Another thing to watch out for is not to let the triggers of stress and/or pain depress me too much. The reason: this is part of my own personal cycle where if I am trying to escape, I can get caught up in it yet again. Now, I can't control when someone dies or when work gets tough.

"Much like trigger-point therapy when I went to the chiropractor or to rehab for an injured elbow, trigger pointers are triggers, such as emotions, thoughts, or actions, that not only trigger my urge to act upon my pot addiction, but also cause me to feel a certain way. These are particularly strong, and they are very hard to resist because they are so intense. It may well be the worst part, and best part of trying to free myself from this addiction because of this crazy phenomenon. I felt almost like I was smoking because I tingled and even had euphoric feelings. This feels good because it's like a free ride without doing it, so it is also enjoyable. The key is not allowing myself to continue to go toward the addiction. It feels so good that it's easy to just decide to go all of the way with it. It's like getting a free can of coke out of the vending machine when you only a dollar in your name. You happily take the coke, but you know you don't need another. Do I buy another one? It'd be awful easy. Dealing with trigger pointers is very prevalent in overcoming pot addiction, particularly early on.

I did start, after all, because I didn't believe sex and emotion had anything to do with one another because of what I saw and perceived.

I can honestly say that I didn't write this stuff down or type it or record it in any way. I wish I had. I wish I had it to show you. I have pages and pages of workout notes, but none with this sort of information. To be able to look back at my progress would be downright rewarding, so that's just a thought from a mind-logger. I tend to do that all too often. At any rate, I tracked when my triggers occurred, their severity, and how long they lasted. Sometimes the triggers were short. I was either too busy or they weren't all that appealing to me. Other times, they were long and drawn out, and they had me very antsy. They did start to make a pattern. And oftentimes they occurred in moments of complete solitude, telling me I had to have it. Tracking my triggers helped me move forward toward refusing to give into them. Another huge factor for me is tracking my sleep, which I found was a part of my addiction.

In order to do this, I had to walk right up to the belly of the beast. I had to confront those thoughts and feelings that led me to fall. But in doing so, I learned how to transform. I learned how to overcome. I learned, for example, that instead of thinking about my anxiety over pot, that I should think about it is a blessing to come. That came true in the form of my wife. I also take the trigger to physically “take care of myself” and transform it by working out. This is also a physical activity, and it is one that can tire you out, so it became a way to transform my triggers into something good and positive for me. Furthermore, I took the trigger of pain and loss of various family members, friends, and friendships/relationships, and looked back in an appreciative manner. I thanked God that I had the chance to spend time with them for the time I did, and I became thankful for the things that I learned that helped me become a better person.

"Putting the shoe on the other foot is always a great way to make sure that I see things from the perspective of others. This is also, in my estimation, the golden rule. This is how I believe we all should live. Something that I have found helpful in my life is to put one the shoe of someone else and look at myself. Of course, I know my secrets that others don't but just bare with me. If someone else knew I was a pot addict, that I wasted countless hours, that I couldn't escape this, what would they think of me? What would my friends, family, potential employers think? When I lift the hood from myself, I was plain disgusting. I received little to no joy from this addiction, yet I couldn't stop myself. But this, this represented a chance to look at myself in a new way. Maybe I could see myself as others see me. As just another person. Maybe I could let it go for once, and then move past it. I could see myself as others would- a clean slate, tabula rasa, and I would take advantage of this second opportunity by doing what I want with my life.

"Up and down. Hot and cold. On and off. That's how I felt on many days. Did I or do I really want to stop and/or stay stopped? Do I want this pot addiction to stop having control over me so that I can have control over it? Some days the answer was an emphatic yes for me. Other days were very difficult. I didn't want to do anything but go back to my comforts. And that comfort was smoking for a couple of hours. For me, this is one of the worst and most depressing parts of being a pot addict. I have to face the question every moment of every day because I don't seem to ever forget. I never fully escape the sensations. I have to concentrate so hard on what I'm doing in the moment. While this is no doubt depressing, it is also a signal that I am pointed into the right direction because I am now thinking about stopping, and that is only a good thing for me.

"The advantage of having a pot addiction (there aren't very many), is that I don't necessarily have as much of a chemical dependency on the activity as a substance abuser would. While I do have urges, and I do want that euphoric high, or that comfort to fall back on, it isn't so much a chemical imbalance that makes me feel bad. This makes it more about me controlling my urges. This gives me a chance to stop what I'm doing and get help from a whole myriad of options. The chance I have is to take my emotions and my stress and to talk about it and let it out. That's the reason I wanted to share this with you. This is therapeutic. I can open up. There is absolutely no shame in talking about problems. I used to believe that I had to be the one that had it all together. I was the guy that got the soccer scholarship with straight A's. I was the college graduate. I was the man in the middle of the divorce holding my family together, so I thought. I was supposed to have this perfect image, and thus I couldn't talk about my problems because they were somehow less than the people around me. In the age of the internet, there is absolutely zero excuse for this phenomenon. It was all too easy for me to smoke for pot for hours, but I couldn't search for even an anonymous chat room or a group or forum to help myself? Learning that taking any of these steps to deal with these emotions is better for me than smoking pot was a very large step into the right direction.

"When I was a kid, my mom had a quote she always told me and even had posted. It was something like “life is ten percent what happens to me, and ninety percent how I react to it.” That was Charles Swindoll, by the way. My attitude is what I want it to be. How I react is ultimately up to me. While my pot addiction is a disease, it did start somewhere. While I can't block urges, I can learn how to cope with them by having an attitude of positivity. If I can in to the situation where I encounter an urge with a depressed, or even, a sarcastic type of attitude, I will have a much more difficult time combating my urge. If I walk out on to the field for a game and I believe I am going to lose, the chances are that I'm going to lose.

To name your fears is tough. I tend to mask mine, to just about half truths about them. I will say that I'm afraid of losing. Or that I'm afraid of being alone. But really I am afraid of failure. That is my overarching fear. I am afraid of failing in anything. It is really hard for me to say that. To be vocal is tough. So, to own up and name off that I have the urge to get high is huge. It doesn't mean that I am a terrible person. To the contrary, I am saying to someone-or myself- that I have the urge and that I need help. This is glorious because it lets that person know that I want help and I want you to be there with me. I have done this in my life to people I had close relationships with.

"I hate resisting urges. I love to drink Sprite. I love to eat candy on occasion. I (used) to love to smoke pot. Yep, I did. At least for a short time before it became just an addiction. It's very tough for me to say no. The Sprite makes me gain weight and it slows me down. The candy does the same and it eats up my wallet. It's easy, in comparison, to give up those two. But my pot addiction is harder. Because it is an addiction. It is tough. It is a crutch. It is something I want and sometimes need. Or at least I feel like it. And reality is my perception of it. So resisting urges is hard for me. The bright spot I see when I do resist an urge, even if it only lasts a little while, is that I am telling myself that this hurts everything in my life. It hurts, no ruins, my social life, and I want one worse than anything. That is my hope. I don't want to ever hurt my wife again, and I would never and have never done it on purpose. I haven't said to myself “she’s boring I need to seek something else.” That's never been what pot was about for me. It was about finding something where I fit in. It was about being able to finally have a “self acceptance.” Not that it really was. And while all of that was a lie, an illusion, it made me feel good and it helped for a short time. Resisting the urge of comfort is the thing that I am most worried about. Because it is the easy thing to do now for me. It's very easy. Comfort is easy. Laying on a nice, soft bed is easy. That's pot. But to lay down on the bed of thumbtacks that is life without pot gives you a new perspective, and it soon makes you realize that you're actually in a pretty good place.

"Urges are very similar to waves we see on the ocean. They come and go. They are up and down. They vary between intensities. Some move me great amount, others move me very little. With my pot addiction, I can help myself avoid the urge by “surfing” through it. This is a very difficult technique because it takes me to the gate of my urges. But if I do it correctly, I can surf through my urge. I think about the sensations that come with smoking pot. As I smoke what do I feel? In truth, very little. I think about this and think is this really what I am missing? That's not that much. I can do this. I think about the momentary euphoria that I get when I'm finished, yeah that's OK. But soon after, and I mean SOON after- like directly- I start to feel ashamed as I trudge away. I think to myself again, is this really something I need or even want? By doing this, sometimes for up to 30 minutes at a time I can outlast my urges and move past them to accomplish the things I want to in life.

By keeping secrets, I am doomed to either make the same mistakes or relapse. Facing my mistakes and owning up to them is what I have to do to learn and grow in recovery. By taking responsibility and making amends to those I have harmed, I am teaching others that it is ok to admit that we are not perfect, that we make mistakes. One of the benefits of taking responsibility for my actions is that it is contagious. I notice that my husband is more apt to apologize and take responsibility for his mistakes because of my example. I also believe that it is an important lesson that I teach my children that I am not perfect and can take responsibility for my part in an argument or situation.","ACCOUNTABILITY / Own up,RESPONSIBILITY,VULNERABILITY / learning and mistakes","Responsibility Rippler,ADMIT / accountability,VULNERABILITY / mistakes & learning",DRUGS/ALC,Shar,female

If bad things happened to me while using, chances are it was because I put myself in bad situations just to get more. My self-awareness allows me to examine why I do the things I do, and rid myself of these excuses. It is hard to spot self-deception by yourself. I spend my time with people who expose my excuses, because often, even now, I cannot always tell when I am deceiving myself. If I am pretending that a relationship is good for me, when it has given me nothing but pain, but I am too fearful of letting go, I allow others to step in and offer advice.

Being sober has definitely provided me a new beginning and a new lease on life. It is important though for me to acknowledge and understand and accept that being sober and being in recovery does not eliminate stressors and elements that life brings my way. I am aware that my recovery is dependent on how I view things and my perception of my capabilities.

It is my witness of these situations that makes me strong. These negative thoughts will not lead two negative beliefs and actions such as using or relapse because I can replace and redirect them with brighter, healthier thoughts. It is also incredibly important for me to understand and believe that what I put into my body has both long-term and short-term effects on it.

But, keeping them locked in my heart will only make my pain greater. Releasing the pain by making amends will truly help me to walk with God and be as he would have me be.

Doing things like looking at my part in the areas where I felt wronged has been an eye opening experience. 4. We will comprehend the word serenity and we will know peace. – When I am in my disease, there is no room for God, no connection to God. If food is my God, I will not know peace. With recovery comes the opportunity to truly connect to my God and lighten the burden that I carry each day. 5. 5. No matter how far down the scale we have gone, we will see how our experience can benefit others.- Just because someone is new to a recovery fellowship doesn’t mean that they can’t serve others in some way to build unity. Making coffee for a meeting or giving hugs to newcomers are things that anyone can do to brighten someone else’s day. 6. 7. 8. 6. That feeling of uselessness and self-pity will slip away. – Feelings like, hopelessness, self-loathing, and depression are replaced with hope, self-love and happiness when I am in recovery. 7. We will lose interest in selfish things and gain interest in our fellows. - The foundation of 12 step recovery is in helping someone else. I get better when I stop focusing on the negative aspects of my own problems and work to recover and help another addict. 8. Self-seeking will slip away. – It’s not always all about me. What can I do for others? That is the way that I continually work my recovery program. I work my steps by continually taking others through the steps. When I am used to a life as an addict where selfishness was my primary objective, selflessness is extremely gratifying, and refreshing. Have you served someone else today? 9. 9. Our whole outlook upon life will change. The glass is no longer half empty. I am no longer isolated in the pit or my disease. I can let light shine on me and step into the sunlight of the spirit. Life has endless possibilities when I follow the path that God has set for me rather than the path of destruction that awaits me in addiction. 10. 10. Fear of people and economic insecurity will leave me. – A few short weeks ago, I was stressed and preoccupied about money. I tried to force solutions that were not going my way. I finally asked God to help me and he showed me a way to make some extra money through sharing my experience, strength and hope in writing about recovery. It was completely directed by God, I just facilitated his will and I couldn’t be happier. I am doing something I love and the financial insecurity is leaving me. 11. 11. We will intuitively know how to handle situations that used to baffle us. - I know now, that if I am bothered by something, it is necessary to address it in some way. I can no longer stuff my feelings because I am afraid of conflict. I also choose not to eat over my feelings. The only way out is through. A much better way to live awaits me if I trust my instincts and address my feelings. 12. 12. We will suddenly realize that God is doing for us what we could not do for ourselves. – Each week, I go to an OA recovery meeting. At the meeting, before you go in there is a prayer board where you write something you are struggling with. One week, I stopped and wrote down help my husband find a job. Within a few months, he got a job in his field. Next, I wrote down help my daughter with her anxiety. I recently found an excellent therapist for her. The last thing I wrote down is help me with finances. I have been given the direction by God to freelance as a writer and write recovery articles. The fear of economic insecurity has left me. The act of writing down my prayers and posting them allowed me to really let go of my control over them. As soon as I let go, God got to work. I know today that God is truly working miracles in my life.","FREEDOM / tools & strategies,PROGRESS / rewards & proud,SOBRIETY / behavior & action","Progress Painter,The Successcalator,Values VIP’r,Sobriety 101'r",FOOD,Shar,female
"Today I am not afraid to seek help. Others in recovery have taught me that this is a strength, not a weakness. Asking for help is a real demonstration of how strong I am, and I do ask for help when I need it. I do not allow my pride to override my personal needs, and I know that I am not alone in my recovery, as we have all needed and received help at one point in our lives.","COURAGE,CONFESSION / powerlessness,WORTHINESS / help,COMMUNITY / ask for assistance","Pride Puffer,The Benefisher,Sobriety SOS’r,CLOSET CONFESSOR / Share & support,VULNERABILITY / reach out for help",DRUGS/ALC,Jen,female
" While using, irrational beliefs were rational to me. I would have a complete anxiety attack if I couldn’t get more blues, dope, or literally any painkiller. It became normal. However, now, this idea has carried over into recovery when dealing with other beliefs. For instance, when my mind tells me I can’t do something, I have the faith and experience to know that’s not true--- anything can happen if I stay clean.","MINDSET,CONFIDENCE /  obstacles & challenge,CHANGE / courage,INNER MASTERY / strength","Old Belief Butcher,Missi-Un-Impossiblizer ,Can’t Cutter,Inner Power Allower,I-examiner - motivations,Inner Winner",DRUGS/ALC,Alys,female
"I am capable of disputing irrational beliefs when my mind is free of drugs/alcohol. When old and recognizable unhealthy beliefs begin to creep in, I can dispute them with my newfound thoughts and healthy beliefs. Today I am in charge of my own life story and I choose to expel any negative beliefs about myself. It is as simple as breathing. As I take a breath in I am absorbing all the positive energy and people around me, and as I take a moment to push that same breath out, I am literally ridding my body mind and soul of these unhealthy thought patterns. I am no longer just an addict because today I am an addict in recovery. I can prove that my beliefs weren’t good, but I can’t prove that I’m no good. Some of my beliefs Am Irrational, and because I recognize this, I am growing into a better me.","CONFIDENCE / acceptance & worth,INNER POWER / Decisions,CHANGE / beliefs","Belief Superseder,Illogical Looper,Mentality Mender,New Pattern Painter / grit & progress",EITHER,Jen,female
"While using, I had this habit of making excuses for my behaviors. Often, if I were late for class or work, I would rationalize that there was absolutely nothing I could do to change that, and that these results had nothing to do with me. Ultimately, everyone saw through it. I didn’t succeed in anything I did. I hit dead ends all the time, and I couldn’t see it was my fault. In sobriety, I avoid rationalizing as much as possible, and begin to learn how to stay accountable.","EXCUSES,RESPONSIBILITY,DEAD END,ACCOUNTABILITY / Own up","Rationalization Rinser,Excuse X’r,Responsibility Rebooter,Dead End Deluder,ADMIT / accountability",DRUGS/ALC,Alys,female
"I imagine that I am riding an unending wave. Things are going great, with no setbacks in sight. I MUST always keep in mind that this wave can send me right back to where I began my temptations. When the wake gets rough, which it will, I intend on holding on and overcoming. Sometimes I will slip, fall off, but I will get back on my board.

"My problems became more manageable in recovery. Before that, everything was always so overwhelming. By sharing my troubles with a sponsor, I learned ways to look at things and handle things in a much healthier way. I became more honest with myself and others about what I was doing. Working my problems through the steps helped to take childhood issues and address them once and for all. To carry those burdens most of my life, was too much. Sharing them with my sponsor helped me to put my problems in perspective.","OVERWHELM,TRUTH / Admit addiction,VULNERABILITY / Show true self","Qualm Quitter,CLOSET CONFESSOR / Share & support,Problem Soul-ver,VULNERABILITY / share challenges",FOOD,Shar,female
"Lazy thinking keeps me in relapse. Everything is too hard, I do not want to change, and I want to stay stuck. Today, I want to think positively, try harder, make changes and get better. I can proactively focus on thinking and doing things that support my recovery. Do I want to give up some days? Yes, I do. Am I terminally unique? No, I am not. With God’s help and a shift in my thinking, I can get better one day at a time.","GROWTH / motivation & boosts,PROGRESS / future & hope,CHANGE / mental confidence,BABY STEPS / slow changes","Lazy Zapper,The Procrastina-shunner,THOUGHTS / positivity,Symbolic Stepper,I-Can-ographer,New Pattern Painter / grit & progress,COMMITMENT knitter / laziness & effort",DRUGS/ALC,Ilanna,female
"It’s been said to call a spade a spade. Bringing my demons into the light can only lesson their power to dominate my thoughts and my life. It’s like I am two people the recovery angel and the relapsing devil. My addiction is like a demon that rears its ugly head when I least expect it. When I am happy, a thought may cross my mind that I should celebrate with a certain food that isn’t good for me. If I’m sad, I could easily have the same problem. My mind will drift to what would make me feel better and I can’t always shake the thought. I have learned that even though I have these thoughts, I don’t have to act on every one of them. I can reach out to another compulsive overeater when I am having crazy food thoughts or do something else like taking a long walk and listening to an OA meeting on my phone to change my train of thought.","DEMONS,THOUGHTS,PROGRESS / reactions & behavior,VULNERABILITY / others who’ve been there","Demon Doctor,THOUGHTS / aware & examine,VULNERABILITY / reach out for help,Illogical Looper,NEW PATTERN PAINTER / share & learn",FOOD,Shar,female
" Just by being in recovery, I have a new calmness. Impulses do come, but my mind-set and perspective on life is very different, so they do not stay very long. In sobriety, I struggled through a romantic relationship. My partner kept using, and eventually, cheating, and I kept excusing their behavior. I kept thinking I could fix them. Becoming so blind to what was actually happening. I acted impulsively every time I was ready to them go, I changed my mind at the last second, and always took them back. The pain, in recovery, was unimaginable. Breaking away was my only option. Learning to control my impulses was my only option. With the right tactics to combat these impulses, like self-respect, self-love, meetings, and other people, I am stronger than the impulses.","TRIGGERS / confidence & strength,INNER POWER / Self control & willpower,MINDSET / no matter what","Bad Influence Butcher,Pain Abstainer,Self Control 101'r,Urge Auditor,Placid Reflux,Craverade",DRUGS/ALC,Alys,female
"The cravings I experience are not imaginary, but very real. My body has become accustomed to having a specific substance inside on a regular basis. And now it’s being denied. I find healthy ways to address my cravings: Go for a walk, talk to another compulsive overeater, or read literature focus on the spiritual solution to my problem. My feelings of denial are perfectly natural.

"When I used drugs, I was alone and I preferred to be alone. Now I know that this was unhealthy. I need friends, especially ones in recovery. Today I open myself up to establish these new connections and new friendships, and my story and journey through my recovery is an inspiration to others. Today, I am my best friend. I am beginning to love myself for my faults and successes. I need a support group that supports my recovery, especially for calling me out on my crap. I don’t need my circle of friends to agree with me, I just need them to be honest with me.
